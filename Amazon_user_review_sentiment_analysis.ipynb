            "Absolutely love this watch! Get compliments almost every time I wear it. Dainty., Scratches, It works well on me. However, I found cheaper prices in other places after making the purchase, Beautiful watch face.  The band looks nice all around.  The links do make that squeaky cheapo noise when you swing it back and forth on your wrist which can be embarrassing in front of watch enthusiasts.  However, to the naked eye from afar, you can't tell the links are cheap or folded because it is well polished and brushed and the folds are pretty tight for the most part.<br /><br />I love the new member of my collection and it looks great.  I've had it for about a week and so far it has kept good time despite day 1 which is typical of a new mechanical watch, i love this watch for my purpose, about the people complaining should of done their research better before buying. dumb people., I was about to buy this thinking it was a Swiss Army Infantry watch-- the description uses the words infantry and army--- when I realized it must be a fraud for $12.00. This should not be offered on Amazon-- it is designed to confuse consumers., Great quality and build.<br />The motors are really silent.<br />After fiddling with the settings my watches are always charged and ready to use., The watch was pretty much as it was described and how it looks. I really like the simplicity of it and it looks pretty amazing. It is slightly too big, so I have yet to adjust it, but I'm glad it's too big rather than too small. The weight is good which is what I was hoping for. Very satisfied with this purchase. I was slightly on the fence getting this one because of the previous fossil watch I had, which by some time, did have some gems fall off from ring around the numbers, but so far so good with this one! Excuse my bad lighting for my pic., I bought this watch on 2013, the screen had a problem 10 months later. I sent the watch back to Casio Service Center in LA, they sent to me a replacement new watch. Last week, less than one year after I received the new watch, the battery is out.  I went to a shop to replace the battery. Then the A button of the watch do not working, so I could not change the time and other settings. I do not think this watch is a good product. Do not buy it., It is a cheap watch that looks cheap.  There isn't much else to say., Heavier than i though, Had it for several weeks now and I love it - reliable, functional, wears easy, not too heavy.  I also get a lot of comments on it - great watch!, This one is different from the rest of my Invictas. I like the big watches but this one gave a classy more defined look for the craftsmanship. All of the colors compliment each other. It all starts from the stitching of the band.  Very nice watch., The watch is attractive and easy to read, except for the date. The little diamonds are very, very tiny. All in all, I'm happy with it., said my wife.., Looks great and love to wear this watch.  Only negative thing is due to its blue/black colors, it is difficult to read in average or low light.  Good thing for me, I wear a watch for looks and not really for telling the time., I really like this watch. It has a great face that contrasts nicely with the white numerals. Keeps time accurately. Overall very pleased. I really like its distinctive look. It's also durable and water proof. I leave it on when I go kayaking or out on the boat fishing., Just what I needed for my Timex watch. Fits perfect on my wrist, Absolutely LOVE this watch! Amazon prime saved me over $400 after tax from the store prices. Between the great buy and the Coolness of this watch it was an amazing purchase. I can't stop looking at it. Movado is an excellent brand. Time keeping is perfect. Quality is perfect., Its too large. When you order check the size of the case., This was a watch I bought during a quick sale thing, so it was cheaper than normal.  I bought it as a daily wear.  It's really a decent watch for the price; a retro look with a modern movement., Thought that I read somewhere that you could swim with it. It does not however bear the 50M Water Resistance designation., This watch is a very beautiful time piece. This also could be an alternative choice to a Rolex submariner. It also has the same features as a Rolex submariner but it's not as good as a Rolex watch but darn close.<br /><br />Take good care of this watch if you get one because it has gold plating on it. This watch is 'Not' a sport watch.<br /><br />This watch features<br />-Rotating timer dial<br />-All stainless steel (kinda heavy)<br />-Glow in the dark<br />-Water resistant to 200 meters (600 feet)<br />-Automatic winding (from wrist movements)<br />-Shows date<br />-Very beautiful<br /><br />Sizeing isn't difficult, I sized mine by using a thumbtack and a hammer to tap the pins out of the band and I tapped a pin back into the band after removing three band links. If you don't know what your doing then just take it to s jewelry store so they can size it for you, This is a beautiful watch. I love the look and feel of it, and I get complimented on it all the time. If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model. When I think of it that way, it's not quite so disappointing., I was very apprehensive about buying a 28 dollar watch online, but it looked so much like the 400 dollar Invicta Coalition forces watch I was wanting that I went for it.  I was very pleased when it arrived.  It is a BIG, heavy, sharp looking watch and I could not be happier. I am sure I will be purchasing the solid black one as well, [[VIDEOID:cc599be25462207f860e42621171d7e1]]This watch has an understated clean and classy design.  It looks elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 7.5\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8\\\\\".<br /><br />The face of the watch is 1 3/16\\\\\" wide and the watch is 1/4\\\\\" thick. The back of the watch states it has Japanese quartz movement.  The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.  It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and include a gift bag.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI for review.  Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I leave critical reviews as well as positive reviews like this one.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, Awesome watch for the price, Nice face, easy to read. The band is a little too small., crap, This is now my everyday watch.  Easy to read with lots of features.  Light  and functional.  You can not beat the price.  It is clean in detail and I love the watch., Watch looks amazing and the features are second to none, but....the watch is small.  I have a PAW-5000 which dwarfs it.  I had to look at the box to make sure I didn't get a woman's watch.  No joke, the band on my, average at best, sized wrist almost couldn't accommodate it.  Probably had 1.5 inch left on the band after I put it on.  Make this Man-size and it would fantastic., Metal color was changed after the first use , which indicates a very poor quality, So far so good. I have only had this watch a few weeks & so far it is still working. Style is really cute exactly as pictured, Have worn it constantly, love the light at night, Great product . Love the continous innovation in this field and given the price-tag of $149, this product is a steal . Bought it 1 week back . Battery is satisfactory . Charges fast . Discharges within 12-15 hours . But it has a touch screen, so naturally its going to eat-up battery. For entry level android-wear, pretty decent, A very beautul and well-made pilots watch. Highly detailed dial,as well. The movement is tack- on for 24 hours but if you are not a ditch digger,wind it 20 revs  daily., excelent product, This press is very well constructed and sturdy. The different dies are easily interchangeable. A good tool for watches and miniature work., Love the look but the leather band is so stiff it doesn't conform well to my wrist., It was bad it didnt fit my 22mm retro casio, Watch kicks ass. Upon putting on this watch you will grow a full beard and be able to tame a pack of wolves by looking at them. 8/10 Only gripe is that I wish the back light was a tad better., Loved the watch; it just did not work supposedly self-winding; tried all possible motions to cause the winder clearly visible from the rear of the watch; no luck, Alrighty, after seeking out the ultimate low-profile, ultra water resistant, mechanical watch with a rotating bezel and date for less than $100, I settled on this.<br /><br />It looks much like the famous Rolex Submariner, and performs similarly.<br /><br />However, after about a year of use now, the paint on the bezel is chipping, and after a decent smack on the hood of a car the crystal has cracked and all but shattered.<br /><br />It keeps time fairly well, gaining about 15 seconds per day, without taking it to a healer for fine tuning., Not bad but a little tacky. It does have substantial weight for a $15 watch., I thought it looked beautiful.  My boyfriend loved it.  It's only been a few days, so I can't comment on durability.  But, I didn't have some of the problems mentioned in other reviews--the little dots around the outside glowed like they were supposed to, it was easy to set including the date, the band was fine and long enough even though my boyfriend wears it loose.  Great price too--I see them in stores for nearly twice what I paid., More beautiful in person. High quality! Looks understated but so sophisticated! It was a gift for my mother and she loved it!, It's a nice watch but if you have a large arm it will not fit  well.  does good under water I use when I go to water aerobic to keep tack of my time, Man watch for woman, just a right size and design for it., I like the watch!  I had its predecessor and enjoyed it until all the numbers started to fall off.  Hope that does not happen to this one.  The numbers run together it's sometimes difficult to distinguish the time.  I'm adjusting to it.  Like the new clasp., I have many Baby-G's, but none have gotten as much attention and compliments as this one. The glitter pops out at everyone and the silver makes it look feminine and sleek. I paid $120 for it, wayy more than I usually pay for Baby-G's, but I think it was worth it, especially since it's a special Japanese model. Probably won't see many people with this watch making it pretty unique. I like the background light is a light blue color, goes well with the color of the watch., Perfect watch for camping and hiking., The watch as expected was an amazing product from citizen, however the the cover was in a damaged condition which was quite upsetting since I was planning to gift this to some one., These were purchased for my daughter and her friend, but I liked them enough that I kept one for myself as well!, This is junk.  Why would you name a watch an ironkid watch if it isn't made for swimming (last time I checked an ironman consisted of swim, bike and run)?  It claims it is water resistant but the watch leaks and it will die if your kid wears it in a pool.  Don't waste your money., Lens cracked on the third day, My husband like it but he would have liked the dial face to be a little smaller. He is not used to the bigger face but getting used to it. The picture product was hard to tell about the dial face and don't think it mention about the dial face being bigger than normal. Besides that everything else is really well made., This is a very nice watch, i love that it's made of wood but black in color. The face is big and has three silver, decorative yet functional dials. It's extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. It's so lightweight you could actually forget you're wearing it. The wood is very smooth and the semi-matte finish is very dressy.<br />The links move easily and is worn without catching or squeezing skin/hair. It's easy to adjust so it will fit a variety of  wrist sizesI love that it's water proof because although very dressy it can be worn for every day use.<br />This would make a great gift for any man in your life.<br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own., Love. That is pretty much it. Item as described, really beautiful and functional., So pretty, strap is so soft, easy pliable rubber material. Unfortunately, bezel does not turn. But I recommend this for everyday nursing use., The size and thickness is Huge. the color is eye Popping.The band is durable and ridged . the only problem I have is that it doesn't glow to mush in the dark. but I like it, the band broke in first week, This is exactly what I was looking for!  I fixed my watch band and haven't been happier!  I didn't need 5, but the extra 4 may come in handy., PERFECT, Disappointed by the huge size of it, although yes they say in the specs it's a 52&#34; etc...<br />Sent it back. The taxes and p&p cost made me pay for it again., Cool, first:<br />i received watch in good condition, however he battery was not working and i changed the battery<br />second:<br />i tried the watch to my hand but unfortunately was not amazing, it is for old ppl more than youth. i am looking to change the model .<br />i dont know if i can change irt from guess agent in Scotland/Edinburgh or not., This is a good looking men's watch that would go well with most outfits, though it's leather strap pushes it to a more dressy watch. It's a simple watch with a day and date window. It is luminescent on the hour marks but not on the watch hands themselves, which is a little weird.<br /><br />I would be curious to see how long the battery lasts. Aside from the watch band wearing out, that would be the weakest part of this watch in the long term., heavier than expected, All perfect!, I got this watch on June 8th . I wore it for three weeks and the watch band fell apart. I called Amazon about the repair and was told  I had to call the seller as the warranty does not cover the band. I have never  had a ceramic watch band thus  I  have never had this problem. The watch is beautiful but it servers no purpose if the band is no good. I will try to call the seller for repair., This is an impressive timepiece that's ready for the business world., This product really surpassed my expectation. It was able to perform very well for me. I used it for my US Army Basic training and AIT. It never disappointed me and it was able to remain sturdy even after a series of rugged use. I highly recommend this product., It is so cheap and gaudy, I will never wear it.  It was misrepresented in the picture and description. The picture is darling but the real thing is beyond cheap.  It will go into the thrift shop donation pile., I bought surprised watch  gift for my daughter. It's beautiful and nice color. She really likes it., A beautiful and precision automatic watch。, Didn't like, Stopped working after one week. Have no idea why. Will try to return or exchange., handy, Love fits good use it every day., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, The photo provided of this watch badly distorts the color of the band, which is in fact much lighter than pictured. It is so light, in fact, that it practically blends into my skin when wearing it. But, I can just replace it for a few bucks, right? Wrong. Skagen apparently uses a proprietary design for their watch bands, and they also don't sell replacements to third party dealers. As far as I can gather I would have to send the watch to them and pay whatever sum they demand just to get a reasonable-looking band.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation: Do not buy this watch, or any other produced by Skagen for that matter., Beautiful watch. Love Skagen watches, hope they'll keep up the quality now the firm's sold. Have had several compliments on the watch., Don't buy this watch.  It looked fine when it arrived, but back of watch has already begun to corrode.  The wrist band turns my wrist green., the dial looks so big compare to this iamge, Battery or watch died less than 2 days after opening., I bought one of these watches in blue and although it is big that is the trend right now.  It is definitely not cheap looking as the previous reviewer stated.  It is a gorgeous watch with beautiful colors.  I am not sure what she was looking for but I completely disagree with her review., I like it!!, It was a gift, I happen to like watches especially with many dials (which I will never figure out) I hope the receipiant may have that ability.<br />The Band is cool looking, so the dial and the band were meant for each other.A truly good looking time piece and well made by a company who has been doing this for many years.If you haven't guessed that name as yet I will now tell you,  &#34;TIMEX&#34;, the price is right, get yourself one., Had it 2 mos and the battery dies. do they think i'm going to send it in for warranty or just go get a new battery. It must have been sitting around for years for the battery to go bad that quick. Buyer beware : great watch old battery, So the watch stopped working almost as soon as I got it but it's so cute that sometimes I'll just wear it as a fashion accessory.  Not very practical but all in all a good buy., 10 years old loved it.  Easy to use, water resistant, alarm, chronograph and has a light., You get what you paid for. The watch is so thick that it does not look nice as it is shown in the picture.<br />It reminds of $9.99 no name brand watches at Walmart. The band's design is not practical., perfect! everything as expected! Thank you!, My son loves it!!! Many great features, he said it is super comfortable, I would recommend it to everyone!!, I love this watch! Aside from being cheap, this watch fits perfectly my son's wrist. My first purchase was the gray one. Then I purchased blue for my husband. Now I'm planning to buy one for myself. It has a simple design and the size and thickness is just enough on my wrist. I really love this watch!, Garbage product that should be sold in a plastic egg in a quarter operated vending machine. I'd give it 1 star but I accidentally got it to work before it fell apart., Absolutely amazing! Perfect!, I've had this blue Chicane for about 3 years now and own another 2 Orients and they are still some of my favorite pieces.<br /><br />The Chicane is the watch I wear most often. It works well in both casual and more formal dress situations, the blue face looks fantastic, the movement is high quality and the price is pretty much unbeatable. You really do get a lot of watch for your money. You can usually find Orient watches discounted throughout the web, so if you pay more than $150 for this watch, you've probably overpaid. That said, I'd stress again that the low price doesn't mean low quality. The watch is accurate and, despite the fact that I wear it everywhere and in all sorts of situations, the face has yet to scratch.<br /><br />The only negative in my opinion, is the folded-steel links in the band. They can pull the little hairs on your wrist occasionally. So a higher quality band might be something to look in to, although, despite the occasional pull, I've stuck with the OEM band for these 3 years and felt fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great looking and high-quality watch that, like all Orients, is a phenomenal deal. Highly recommended., work for a week dont broke, Bought 7 of of these as gifts for my groomsmen and they all loved it.  The watches arrived within 3 days!  Watch looks great.  For the price and quality it was a great deal.  The size is good not too big for a square face watch.  Read the instructions on how to set the watch as because it can be tricky.  The subdials are quite small but still readable, and for a watch under 40$ with day and date dials still worth the money.  2 watches did arrive with dead batteries, but upon contacting amazon, they refunded me a fair amount to purchase and install batteries on my own., The watch is practical, stylish and very reasonably priced., Great watch, really pretty, NOT water resistant. This claims that you can even wear it in the shower... however, one day of wearing it in rainy weather and the face is foggy. Other than that, I LOVE this watch., Horrible watch. Don't buy. The crown came.off after one year with minimum use., Fantastic if you need a watch and have Android phone. If i didn't want to wear a watch i'm not sure i would need it. Keep you from getting you phone out so much for new updates and texts and such. i like being able to change faces and colors. i'm just starting to download games and apps for it.battery life is one waking day. charger is cool., Perfect watch for my elk hunt.  Rugged.  Big.  Non-glare.  Amazing backlight.  Super light.  Super comfortable. Perfect!!!  Thanks Amazon/Casio., Love the looks,quality  n sizes of watch. Unfortunately I could not get it working properly. After 3 days trying , send it back. I am sure it was me running out of patients., handsome watch. hands are a bit difficult to read., After two months of careful wear the cap/screw that holds the wristband pin fell off (and was lost) - and being that I have missed the 30 day sellers return deadline I now have a pretty much brand new yet useless watch!, Excelent for the price., I wish it was less manly looking (yes, I know it is a man's watch), and I wish that you had the capability of setting two different countdowns, as I use this for work breaks, but I'm still pretty happy with the features., This watch stops working if left on dresser for over 2/3 hours. This is happening since it was bought. I am not sure if it is the issue with battery or something else. after giving a few shake it get back its life and there is a need to reset time date etc. NOT worth the time. Certainly it is very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone this watch., I like it, It's a beautiful watch that I absolutely love, but it is running 3-4 minutes per month too fast.  It is expensive to fix.  I haven't yet looked into the warranty from Amazon, but it was a gift from my wife on our wedding I don't want to send it somewhere to have it adjusted.  I am just living with it for now., I was hesitant to buy this watch at first after reading the reviews about the band being too small. Now after receiving it I find that it fits me perfect! (By the way my wrist is not skinny). I work at a jewelry counter where we sell watches and this watch's band seems to be the average length of a normal digital woman's watch. Anyways, I'm happy with it., We looked at many clocks before coming across this one.  It looks very nice runs very smoothly/quietly.  We are very satisfied with this product., I got a deal on this watch at a local department store, but after I got home and read the reviews, my guard was up already. Well, less than a week into wearing it, I took it off tonight and my wrist was green. Ugh! Frustrating! These US Polo watches have great style and weight in a lot of cases, I just wish they would up the price by about $20 and put some real quality into them, like genuine stainless steel!  Some of the other issues I noticed include: pulling the crown stern in and out moved the entire movement inside the watch, the analog and digital times were off by more than five seconds within a week, the stopwatch time was hard to see in most lighting conditions, and, as others have undoubtedly mentioned, the bezel doesn't actually rotate. I don't expect much for the low price these watches are sold at, but several of those problems I listed are real deal breakers in my book, so back it goes tomorrow., nice but it's a really noisy watch.<br />you will hear it all time... literally every second ..., The strap was well made, however, I had ordered black and it was a dark brown.  Returned for a refund which I received quite promptly., Looks awesome., All I can say is this is an amazing watch. It's nice and heavy and looks and feels so expensive! I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it!, I love this watch. It looks professional and stylish without being ostentatious, and actually looks awesome with my glitzy but delicate engagement ring, adding a hint of classic menswear. It's sturdy and you really can't beat the price, plus I have relatively narrow arms/wrists and the size is perfect. It has a really nice weight to it and everyone always thinks it's much more expensive than it really is., Bought it for my girlfriend, she loves it. She works in the health bussines so she needed something easy to clean, that could get wet and that matches her uniform. Great watch and theStar Series on the dial gives the watch a nice look., muy buen producto, My wife really likes the cool blue silicon wristband and watch face on this Armitron sports watch. It's stylish and fun. It has many holes for adjustment, so even very small wrists should find the proper adjustment (our four year old could wear it comfortably). The setup was fairly simple and standard, with two time zones able to be set, a stopwatch, countdown timer, and alarm. The weekdays on the display are very tiny to read, and makes the display seem a little cluttered or crowded. It is easily visible under water, with little to no glare, and seems a solid sports watch with no frills. While you can wear it in pools and the ocean, you can pretty much predict that if you do that often, the bands will degrade and discolor--but then again that's why you wear your sports watch and not a nice one. Also sunscreens etc, are unfriendly to watch faces and bands., I wasn't expecting much for the price....It came on kind of a cheap necklace type chain, but the watch itself was actually a lot nicer than I had ever expected., I was looking for a Seiko for my husband.  He likes it.  Wish the face was glow in the dark but other than that it fits the bill., I am very happy with this purchase.  I have had it for a month and have used it to adjust the length of 4 watches so far.  Very good quality.  Easy to use.  I have saved a lot of money by not having to take my watches to the jewelers to have them shorten the watch bands.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone.  Delivered on time and without problems., I got this for my daughter for her 7th birthday and she was so excited. She has worn it everyday since receiving it. The watch fits her perfectly, with plenty of room to grow.It looks different from different angles, this makes her so ecstatic.she told me that this was the best gift she'd ever received., Gift for someone, I cant really comment on it., Soft, durable, comfortable band, and the face looks exactly as it does here. Reduces glare and the light up feature is great., Battery died in 2 weeks!!!!!!!, I absolutely love the design and the quality of the watch materials. When I received the watch, it was set correctly so I did not have to make any adjustments to the date or day for almost 2 months after my purchase. Sadly, when I went to adjust the date because it was off from having a shorter month, I found out this part of the watch was broken. I do not wear it often and am not rough on it (primarily worn in an office setting). The band and watch face still look close to new, so I'm assuming the dial was broken when I received it and I realized it too late to return it. This is the third time this has happened to me when ordering a watch through Amazon. I absolutely love Kate Spade designs and they are generally of a superior quality, but when ordering on Amazon, you typically get a product that looks or functions like an item that was rejected by the maker because of minor dysfunctions. The gold-on-gold color make the watch slightly harder to read and the date dial is quite small, but the pink hands really help with visibility. The leather on this strap is very thick, which takes some adjusting to if you are used to wearing lower-profile watches. It is also a light enough color that if you are wearing it to work and are rubbing up against printed materials, the band will get a slight discoloration from the ink. The watch face is large, as other reviews suggest. I have a medium sized wrist (~ 16 cm), but it does not look too large on my wrist. When wearing it, I can definitely feel that I have a watch on, but the size makes it look like a nice statement piece., I really wanted to love this watch but I don't.  Compared to the women's Timex Ironman Triathlon watch it is replacing:<br />1.  The watch is much heavier and bigger.  I really notice the bulk and weight on my wrist when I'm working out<br />2.  The date display is goofy.  The year is displayed first.  Duh - who doesn't know what year it is?  The month/date has a small display which is difficult to read at times.  I went all through the instructions to see if I could change this, but could not.  The Ironman defaults to DAY of week then the DATE of month.  That's what I need, and I need it to be displayed clearly.  Done.<br />3.  The display of the Casio can be difficult to read in bright light conditions.  I don't know if it's my sunglasses, the glare, or what.  But I don't have the same problem with my Ironman watch.<br />4.  This watch is double the price of the Timex Ironman.<br /><br />I prefer the lighter/smaller Timex with easier to read display for half the cost.  My Casio is collecting dust on my shelf, although I will admit it looks nicer than the Timex sitting there., I've had it a month so far.  It's not as high quality as the old one but I like the design.  Very convenient as a bedside alarm.  I find it loud enough, contrary to other reviews.  Quality is okay., Had not noticed that this is the very large watch face and band. I like the watch face fine though it's bigger than I anticipate. Silicone band seems cheap and it's stiff. Put on a leather band that I had for my other watch which was a smaller size, but made the band work ok., Bought this watch in 2014 and wear it at least 75% of the time including in the shower, running, hiking, kayaking, swimming, and all other sorts of activity. It only recently &#34;broke&#34;. Honestly, the circle piece of the face came off, but the watch still functions perfectly. Picture shows what I am talking  about. Purchasing another one and hoping it will last another 3 years!, Not what I expected...., coolest watch ever, Extremely well I made watch. It even has a solid stainless link bracelet. Deep dish dial and very beautiful., Amazing, I am extremely pleased with the product.  Excellent watch!, Too tight., It pains me to rate this watch with 1 star because I love the way that it looks and wears, but if I'm being honest with you and myself, it's a P.O.S.  I'm not a watch snob, in fact this is the most expensive watch that I've ever purchased ($190) and it's been the worst experience I've ever had with a watch. I purchased from the seller Area Trend on Amazon so I can only assume that it's an authentic Luminox but wouldn't be surprised to learn that it's a fake/knock-off/refurbished. When it arrived it wasn't running...Tap it and it would start running...a few hours it would stop again.  I sent it back and they sent me a new one (I had to pay for shipping and wait a couple weeks).  About 3 months later the exact same thing begins to happen...stop periodically and start back for a few hours.  Rather than send it back to wait several weeks and pay shipping again, I took it to a watch repair shop thinking maybe it's a bad battery connection but I find out that it is a faulty mechanism and required a new one.  My watch repairman orders a new mechanism from Luminox and installs it for about $65. Here we are at about 10 months later (owned the watch for a total of about 15 months) and I look down at the watch and the second hand has fallen off and is shaking around loose under the crystal. I'll take it to the watch repairman again, get him to fix it again, wear the hell out of it till it screws up again, but I would never buy this watch again.  Very disappointed in what I thought was going to be a cool watch to own., The smile on my significant others face was worth the cost the watch was prefect better then I expected, Better quality than picture sugests..., Happy with product, Very nice watch. I get compliments all the time and everyone asks where I got it. This is an excellent watch for business/formal types of gigs that doesn't break the bank. Not heavy on the wrist., Perfect size, light weight, and matches almost everything. A negative is it ticks loudly., Pretty much what I wanted, disappointed with the band. Very stiff, and the end was squared. Hard to feed through buckle., Love it ! ; got it for my lil brother & it looked just like the picture & didn't look or feel cheap. Only bad thing is I got it to help him tell time however the numbers are extremely small, This is a nice sports watch.  Bigger than it looks on the picture, so it want disappoint if that's one of the desires in getting it., I wasn't able to get this to work. At all. So it's sitting in a box somewhere., The Swiss Legend World Timer is a nice higher end quartz movement watch with dressy looks and nice functionality.  The watch is BIG coming in at 48.5 mm case diameter so this is basically a large man's watch.  I would say it wears small-average for it's size but again it's a big watch.<br /><br />It does have gold accents on it but it doesn't come off gaudy at all.  Overall I highly recommend this if you are looking for a large men's quartz watch for dress occasions., Gorgeous watch! Works fantastic. The dial is of the right size for my not so monstrous hands (7&#34; diameter at wrist - Left Hand), if you have big arms, this may look tiny. The two tone double lock metal strap is gorgeous. It has polished center links with brushed finish links on either side. I had to remove 3 links to fit well on my wrist. There are 5 more links that can be removed to fit ones wrist (so a total of 8 links can be removed to fit ones needs). Hope this gives you an idea of the range of wrist sizes this can fit. I love the big Yellow stop watch arm. All are screw in buttons and knobs, what I mean by that is, you have to unscrew the rings by the two buttons at the top and bottom and the ring at the center knob to make it work. Once you are done using the knob and the buttons make sure to screw back the rings tight, this I suppose makes it water tight. The small dial on the left is your seconds dial, the one at the bottom is your alarm and the one at the top is your stop watch dial. Surprisingly all of the arms fall right on the marker lines when they work, may be I got lucky or may be the quality of the product is that good...I don't know! The hour/minute arms and the main dial has fluorescence on them to aid in visibility in dark surroundings. I have owned this for little over 2 weeks now! The dial is supposed to be used to measure 7 or 8 different parameters, I haven't had a chance to do any of that...Sorry! I have to say at least three others in my work place have bought this piece in the past 2 weeks since they saw this on me!, I was very disappointed that the &#34;illumination&#34; is limited to the teeny tiny little LED section of the watch face.  Not useful at all for nigh time display., Recommended ..., Automatic movt,mop dial,open heart,44 diamonds,butterfly clasp,and on. This was an anniversary gift for my wife. The diamonds may be small but in the light- WoW ., The wife likes it n she's happy with the watch, Little upset....the hands don't match up with the hours and minutes...sad ...because it's a beautiful watch that I can't wear., Excellent watch for the money. Sharp understated design. Particularly good if you have a smaller wrist. Hard to find a Chronograph for small wristed. This one fits well!, Awesome and Quick..Thx, This watch looks good and real leather band but when you take it out of the package it feels cheap, lightweight, and you begin to notice the lack of beefiness, and masculinity points dropped. It lacks weight, but it would be good for someone that needs a watch that is light weight, has visual appeal, and isn't concerned about it getting chewed up or broken., Just like in the picture but the textured dial isn't as shiny as you think it is but still shiny., Bought this as a gift for my grandfather, its beautiful and looks just as nice and high quality as the more expensive ones! He loved it, great gift for men, who can be so hard to shop for. It's something they wouldn't buy for themselves but can still appreciate and use!, This is a gorgeous watch. I almost canceled my order because I was scared it might look to masculine for my female wrist. Im glad I didn't. The combination of colors with the grey polished metal face, stainless steal bezel and black croc band gives it a nice rich look. I have an average female wrist and it fits fine. What doesn't show on the pic or video is the number markers are indented into the metal which plays beautifully in the light. Its a steal for the price and works for a man or a woman., Beautifull watch im very happy with this piece actually i want the 1020 model, is the same white instead orange, The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., Loving it.  Works fine, easy to set up, etc.  I used to have one of these when I was a kid, so it's the nostalgia that's really got me going., Very eyecatching obviously.  I found the back of the watch to have a bunch of different metal pieces which uncomfortably dug into my skin.  The weight of the watch, while noticeable, is not unbearable.  The band got quite discolored around the area of the clasp.  Mine is grayish black now besides being orange., I was looking for a watch with a brown strap that had a somewhat timeless look.  I almost went for a chronograph just because I love the way they look but for the price on this watch I couldn't pass it up.  This is a nice addition to my very small collection and it's my first automatic.  I only wear it once or twice a week but setting the time and date only takes 30 seconds so it's not a big deal.  I first thought the inscription on the band was cheesy but the more I thought about the words &#34;without liberty life is a misery&#34; the more I wanted the watch.  The inscription adds a little flair to an otherwise simple yet sophisticated watch.  The band has variations in the brown color so this watch can be paired with light brown shoes/belt as well as dark burgundy / oxblood shoes/belt.  It fits well and looks great., Beautiful., like them., not a bad watch but don't use it on water or else the it will stop working, Beautiful watch that is even nicer in real life. When first received placed on window sill for about two hours and has worked great since. Strap doesn’t pull arm hair and fit great right out of the box. My only issue is that the hands or numbers are not luminous. This was an oversight by me and should have checked before I ordered but no fault of Amazon or seller so they shouldn’t incur the cost of shipping to exchange. Overall a good buy just do more research before you order to be sure what you select has all options wanted or needed.I plan on keeping as everything else is perfect., the band looks good but it was a bear getting the links out to resize it without the holder to keep the band aligned while removing the extra links., Excellent Product, competitive price and quick delivery., This band fits my watch well and I expect it to last a very long time., The crown and stem fell out within 48 hours. The replacement watch HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM! So very disappointed with this model, which is a shame., Good quality band but it is about a half inch too short.  I can use it as is but it would be comfortable if it were a bit longer., I like the watch but I don't like the buckle on the watchband.  It's cheap plastic.  It would be better if it was made of metal.  Also, when searching for a replacement watch band, it is impossible to find a better upgrade.  All I could find to replace the band with, if I ever had to, was the exact same cheap band that it came with.  If not for the crappy band, I would have given this watch a 5 star rating., So far I have used the watch for a week. Looks clean and simple to use. The weather function is simple and on point so far. The band is comfortable and holds nicely without the end falling out of the loop. Havent used all the other functions yet, so I couldnt rate this watch five stars., The band is super small...the watch head-is much bigger-I really help-the band would fit the &#34;watch&#34; size...A bigger band would make it more appealing...for the price-you would think the band would be larger.., Amazing watch, Love every aspect of this thing and especially for its price. So worth it., Works, It's not really blue at all..., Love this watch. I actually purchased it for my son. It’s awesome., I recently went shopping for a new watch when my old Timex band started cracking after 8 years. Duct tape works ok to keep it together but I needed something that looks good on my wrist.<br /><br />I went to Target looking for a new band and I decided that for a few dollars more I could just buy a new watch and use the old one for yard work and working out.<br /><br />This model met all my requirements. I wanted a clean easy-to-read design with date and day, a comfortable brown leather band and a face that lights up clearly in the dark. So far after a few weeks I have been very happy. It looks as good as my $150 Seiko at a fraction of the price as well as keeps good time. It's still accurate to the second since I first set it.<br /><br />I am a medium to large man who normally can only get the last notch buckled in most watch bands. This band will buckle to the second notch. The advantage of leather is that it CAN stretch, so don't worry if you have large wrists. A few minutes soaking the band in water will let it custom fit even the largest of wrists.<br /><br />Design wise this watch has a nice clean legible design. I'm not going SCUBA diving or orienteering in the woods. I just want a nice stylish watch that will tell the time accurately at a glance without the distraction of nonsensical mini dials. The smaller case still looks good on my larger than normal wrist and doesn't catch on doorways or sleeves like a large bulky case would.<br /><br />I've always had good luck with Timex watches since I was a kid. Good quality for the money. The only reason I have an expensive Seiko was because it was a gift and I only wear it for formal occasions.<br /><br />Like the old ad says, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking..., I love having this watch!  Make sure to allow it to charge in the sun when you first get it because it's solar.  You will lose some of the functions if it's not charged up properly., This automatic watch keeps great time when worn regularly or placed on a winder. Holds time for at least 48 hours. It looks great....face is a darker blue than pictured under normal light conditions, but a bright blue in direct sunlight. The upper crown controls only the day of week, which can be set in English or Spanish. The upper crown screws down, but not as securely as the main crown.<br /><br />My only knock is that the band pinches the skin and hair on my wrist... plus it has that unsightly dolphin emblem. Do yourself a favor and either buy this watch with the metal band or replace the one that comes with it. I replaced it with a metal band for less money than it would have cost to buy it that way., I'm preparing to do my clinical rotation next month and this is a great, inexpensive watch for me to help take vital signs manually, such as tracking  pulse and respiration measurements using the second hand.  The interface of the watch is big and clear so I can keep track of the seconds without having to squint my eyes closely at the watch.  In addition, the company was very responsive when I reported that my watch had a stain on the interface, which they quickly replaced for me with a new one that came in a week later.  The band is kind of stiff, however the resourcefulness of the watch to help me take manual vital sign measurements is more of an important purchasing factor for me., A bit flimsey, Nice time piece. Keeps precise time and is sturdy to wear daily. Not super big like some., I've been wearing versions of this watch for about 20 years.  It's easy to use, easy to see the display, comfortable, reliable, and affordable. The small &#34;downside&#34; is that this watch is very ordinary.  Like the title says, it's the Corolla of watches., awesome!!!, Cute watches for the prices. They are huge so if you have a small wrist you'll need to get some links removed ., I like the watch it looks nice and fits comfortably on my wrist. But I was looking the watch over and noticed that it is advertised as being Swiss quartz movement and the watch I received is a Japan movement. This concerns me some as I am not sure what exactly this means as far as why mine is different than the one advertised., The time knob is difficult to operate. The design could and should be improved., Returned it as it did not work!, This watch is just awesome.., Seems like a nice watch and easy to read. Still unraveling the connection with the Seafire; now that I have the watch, I looked on-line at a Seafire's instrument panel and specifically the clock, the face doesn't really look like this at all. By the way, this is the stiffest leather watch strap I have ever encountered, hopefully that bodes well to longevity., it is beautiful and it works just fine, only used two days, one of the lug was broken., This is a great watch and I very much enjoy wearing it. I wear it almost all the time unless I am working in the yard or doing something where I wouldn't want it scratched or damaged, though I have no reason to believe this watch can't handle almost any situation. The black light does illuminate the number dial sufficiently, but as others have said, it doesn't illuminate the hands very much, and definitely doesn't illuminate the LCD screens at all. The watch is pretty large, so if you have small wrists (I have average wrists) this watch may feel rather large., bangles seem like they wont last, but im watching closely, This watch is beautiful!  Way better than the picture... and the pic is fab. I love it!, It looks good and in the rose gold it is definitely an eye catcher!! Enjoy wearing it too. It looks great with my MK rose gold metallic Cindy large satchel handbag I also purchased on Amazon Prime a few months back. I'm a Prime shopper for sure!, junk, 👍👍👍, No instructions, couldn't get it to work.  Useless, Lots of compliments..., A very solid, good looking watch. It was given as a gift and was loved by the recipient. The Mother of Pearl face makes this watch stand out above others. So far it has kept perfect time. The solar feature is great. No more batteries to replace., the vibrating alarm doesn't vibrate for a long period of time - the vibrations turns off after 2 vibrations., I got one of these beauties.  Looks nice, the outside is very high quality.  The rest is the opposite.  Cannot figure out how to hack the watch to synchronize the time, despite the user's manual.  The time is hard to tell, one has to search for the hour hand of the watch, because the three dials are mostly black or dark, same as most of the hour hand.  Worst of all the big red 60 second counter hand which jumps perhaps every second, does not line up with the 60 hash marks on the dial, but only about half the time.  Guessing, either the 60 second counter hand jumps at different intervals and they are not equal, or the hashmarks on the dial are not spaced equally. After nearly 162 years of watch making, a manufacturer should be able to divide the circle to 360 equal spaces and also should be able to make a second hand jump exactly 1/60th minute, every second. Operating the watch is NOT intuitive, the three time measuring dials are impossible to zero once.  The watch measures, stops, as if has its own mind, one may need a six month course to learn how to operate it. Question:  Why Tissot cannot fix the shortcomings of the watch, as I am sure they read the watch collector's blogs and many dozen people point out the same thing, I did above.  I have over two dozen watches and this will be the first one I get rid of, gladly., I got this on another website in Dec. 2014.  Very adorable watch. I loved it. Note, the past tense. I watched my hands and rinsed off dishes (no deep water immersion), ordinary daily routines. Somehow water got into the face, and it stopped.  So be very careful of not getting it wet, the water may leak in., clock meets all expectations, Perfect timepiece for me and to top it all it came as a water resistant watch. The compass is not always acurate though but thats not nothing to complain about because the watch has real 24hour operation, The watch came in a timely manner and in an absolutely beautiful box. The watch itself has a gorgeous antique styled face, the winding action is precise and tight and the casing is a total conversation starter. This watch is easily worth twice the cost., It's ok, This does not work with the IPhones, Perfect fit for my casio g shock watch model 2608., My 9 year old son loves it. It is a bit large on his hand but not too bad.  update: lowered to 2 stars.. 3 months have passed since we bought it. A couple of times when my son took it to the pool it got condensation which prevented seeing anything on the screen and this lasted not a few minutes but a day or so.   Now it just stopped working altogether., its okay kind of plain, Fit perfect, I also ordered the Batman watch and instead received the Superman watch.  Do not order this item if you expect to get what you ordered., Great product...5 star for quality... 5 star for being, and looking like the pic. This watch is sturdy and has lasted longer than any of the cheap plastic watches I've usually purchased in the past. I am typically the destroyer of watches because of my job but this one is still going strong and that is a lot to say for someone like me who usually breaks them in about a month. You won't be disappointed with this one!, Very pretty watch with an easy to read big dial.  I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase., Terrible quality and cannot be programmed without the instructions and the instructions that came with it were in Chinese. Terrible purchase., I generally love Time Indigo but this one has been a disappointment. The Blue band started fading within a few weeks and I've lost time several times. I have not yet determined what caused that since it is not constant just occasional., We purchased this watch for our son (just turning 10). It is a great watch and he loves it. I only rated it as a 3 instead of a 5 because the band was rather long. The watch is identified as a Kids' watch however, the band is as long as my own Casio (AQS800W-1B2VCF). Also if you search the model number for the &#34;kids&#34; watch it will show up twice, labeled as a kids watch and as a men's watch.<br /><br />In short, I think it would be fine for a kid 10 years or older. A younger child may have too much of the band overhanging., Very pretty, elegant, I needed this to replace the far too small original brand on my LG G Watch.  Perfect length for me!, Very pleased.  Beautiful watch and very fast delivery., Love this watch it is my third Invicta from Amazon , however it worked for a week then would not keep time, I was on the road so had a new battery installed to see if that was the problem, No,  So I have shipped it of to Invicta with the $28 check  know we will see what happens .<br />My other two Invicta`s have been great. keeping good time., Just whatI was looking for, This is a beautiful watch.  I have worn other watches by Kenneth Cole for years.  This is just as nice of quality as previous styles.  The rose color is softer than some other brands and looks more delicate and professional.  The numerals on the face are Roman and that also adds character to the watch., All perfect!, Bought this for my husband for our 7th anniversary. It really is a cool looking, trendy watch that fits his style very well., Very classy, a little spendy, but you get what you pay for. My son loves it., No complaints. It's incredibly light and it tells the time., super, Works will with my watch.Thanks, super slim and chic. I gave it as a gift and it has been getting raves - from the recipient and non-stop from her friends., I had a watch just like this but it was blue and the rubber broke and I liked the style and brand so much that I bought another in my favorite color. It is waterproof to a certain deep depth and the packaging confirms that. Has a speed timer, an alarm, a secondary time as well as the normal time and day month and year., Like the style, For forty bucks, this thing is solid and BEAUTIFUL!, I love it, very comfortable. Feels weak in the bracelet., excellent watch, I haven't been impressed with this watch since I purchased it 4 months ago.  First, like others have mentioned, the metal band squeaked a lot when I first got it -- it was very annoying to constantly have a squeaking noise coming from my wrist when I moved.  I was able to silence the noise with a few shots of silicone lubricant.  Second, the watch does not keep time very accurately, even when I wear it every day, sometimes winding it if I have had it off for more than a few hours.  In my case, the watch gains a few minutes every few days.  Third, despite the beauty of the watch in the photo, in reality it is very hard to see the silver hands against the silver background -- just glancing at it to see the time isn't possible; you have to look at it for several seconds to distinguish where the hands are, and which hand is which; I hate wearing it in low light, and often I only choose it wear it (as opposed to my other watch) if I'm going to be outside where I can see the face better.  Finally, and most annoying, the crystal somehow became chipped under normal wearing conditions a couple of weeks ago, and now it has moisture in it.  In all my life of wearing watches, I've never had a crystal chip; and I know I didn't do anything outside of normal use.  So now, because the crystal isn't covered under warranty, it's going to cost $45 for repair.  I've had a lot of watches in the same price-point as this watch during my life, but never one of such poor quality.  I won't be buying a Relic watch again., That's what I want, I have had some version of this watch for 30 years. There is nothing better. The countdown  timer is a must for me. Thanks for keeping it available!, Band is impossible to shorten. Uses very tiny screws. I bought a 0.8 mm screwdriver and could listen it., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, Shipping?... Less than two days!<br />This watch is really nice. Reminds me<br />of a Panerai Daylight.<br />Works fine, I'm happy with it.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, Love the watch!  Beautiful, bright and clear display.  This is my work and snorkeling watch.<br /><br />This is not a con.  I knew what I was buying.  I wish that Armitron would also make sleeker LCD display watches with large numerals for more normal wear.<br /><br />If you want an all around good, and very legible LCD watch, I can only recommend it!<br /><br />Bernie, Excellent quality. Solid. Would highly recommend., Great watch for everyday use!  It is big enough to see the time even without putting the watch directly in front of your face... so if you need a watch that you can look at subtly (if you're on a bad date), this is the watch to get! : ), The picture of the watch on Amazon showed chrome plated hands on the watch.  The watch arrived with grey metal hands on the watch which make it somewhat difficult to read in low light conditions.  Otherwise it is great!!, Great Genuine Casio Watch!<br />-Japan made (Quality Wise)<br />-Easy to setup<br />-Classy look (Thanks to its retro design and gold tone)<br />-It's for MEN! (Thanks to its black frame color and band design)<br />-A must have model of Casio because it's very hard to find in any local store or atleast just in Australia.<br /><br />Delivered a little late than expected but did refund the shipping fee (Carrier issue, not the seller). But very satisfied with the watch. Thanks!, Sun permanantly turns it browninsh. Forget it., clock meets all expectations, I bought this watch from Amazon as the seller. So I will first review the Amazon experience, then the watch itself.<br /><br />It's quite difficult when it comes to rating Amazon, thing is the experience I've had with them over the years is incredibly positive. What I can  say is, the watch is authentic and I had it inspected by a Tissot shop. The packaging was great and the watch box had all the catalogues with it. When the seller is Amazon, buy with confidence.<br /><br />The watch itself is really a true piece of art. The blue dial and the outer black case with the white numbers all come together in perfect harmony with the stainless steel bracelet. It's subtle and a looker at the same time. It's not small whilst not too big either. For me it's about the perfect size. It's a bit heavy, but this only adds to the great feeling you get when you wear it. The thing I love most about this watch, is that with a quick glance, you get the time, day and date. I definitely recommend this watch., It seems to be a very cheap watch.  Accurate time keeping isn't possible.  Band fell apart after 3 weeks., I love this watch but within a month, the clasp has broken. Really disappointed!, OK so I have had this watch for a few days now and I can easily say is the best cheaply priced watch I have ever owned. It fits comfortably on the worst and it has some weight to it but not too much. Just enough. I have gotten multiple compliments on the sport amount of time I have had it., Good watch links scratch easily, The band is made out of some type of plastic and when it arrived weeks later the band was stained or had some type of water damage.. Got a full refund so happy at the end. ✌🏽😄, Disappointing!  After receiving the watch, reading the manual, and setting the city and Day Light Savings Time.  The auto setting for Day Light Savings time did not work.  The watch also was turned toward the west sun for 4 to 5 hours for two straight days, yet it never left M (medium power setting) designation for the solar battery.  It should have moved by the end of the first day to H for high battery power.  I returned the watch to Amazon, and received a full refunded of the purchase price., Very fast shipping.  The watch strap was like described. I have a small wrist and it fit perfect.  I am happy with purchase., Excellent. My son loves it. He wants to swim with it, so we are yet to pass this test!, Bad Quality in this moment no working, The product is good when it works.  Within months of purchasing this, one side of the winder stopped working.  The seller sent a part that we replaced ourselves and it seemed to get it to work...for a little while.  Few months later, both sides of the winder stopped working.  Product works less than a year.  Contacted seller and was told no warranty.  So unless you are good with paying for something that last less than a year...would not recommend buying this., The large size is QUITE large--had to return it for a medium, for my husband who is a pretty big guy., Very v cheaply made broke within the first 3 days, Like it, All perfect!, Handsome watch. However two caveats; one, the attractive band is way to large. I had to buy a smaller one that cost nearly as much as the watch! Two, the second hand has a loud ticking sound... can be very distracting at bight., like them., I really like this watch.  The face is very big--really more the size for a man, which is perhaps why it's called &#34;unisex.&#34;  I can't imagine a man wearing it however; the  pink color and the glittery band make it quite feminine.  I would give this watch 5 stars except for 2 things: the day and date are difficult to advance correctly, and the plastic buckle is rather delicate--I envision it breaking at the point where the pin joins the buckle to the band., The watch is beautiful! It is a little bigger than I expected, but after wearing it, it is perfect., The strap itself is pretty great but it didn't come with the springs to put it on my watch (which every strap I've ordered online thus far HAS included) so I was kinda bummed about that.. It unfortunately doesn't look really good with my original white Pebble watch so I won't be using it after all - but it's a good strap if you have a conventional watch to re-strap!, The SNZH53 is a very good automatic watch at its price point. It keeps good time, has a decent power reserve and the deep blue of the face and bezel is very pretty. The crystal is fairly scratch resistant. Not as good as high end watches, but the hardlex will prevent all but the hardest bangs from leaving a mark. The worst thing about this watch is the bracelet. It feels light and cheap. If you're planning to wear it on an aftermarket strap, as I do, that's not an issue. Though it's a &#34;divers watch&#34; it doesn't have a screw-down crown so it's not really great for doing a lot of underwater wear. That said, I've gone swimming with it on and had no ill effects., This watch is very attractive, and I very happy to wear it., Products like these which need time to show what they are and how good or bad they may be, need TIME. We have not even given it as the gift we bought it fopr, and may be later they would be owner will advise how is was.<br />Please give these items time to prove or disapprove themselves., I ordered this watch online and I absolutely love it. It's true to the picture, very sophisticated. It's great for nights out. Overall an amazing purchase!, i wear it often.  works well, Classy!!, perfect, It looks even better in person than it does in the picture. Awesome watch, I love Nixon., Pelage dial with tiny jewels positioned at 10,25,40,and 50 minutes. There is a date function its a perfect size and it is comfortable. Oh, yeah, its also gorgeous., Husband likes it., Very sturdy and light., Very cheaply made. Battery doesn't even work, Too large by far! Cannot be adjusted., Love it, looks just like the picture. Actually a lot nicer in real life because of the mother of pearl casing and the grey leather and rose-gold contrast.<br /><br />Also, it is quite small. So just read the description carefully before you buy because it really is a small small watch. But I love it exactly that way, I think it looks perfect!, excellent, Very nice watch , very high quality and 80 hours power reserv is excellent future , love it. Due its size , which is on medium-small size, for perfect balans I recommend this watch for smaller and skinny types of wrists,, Black strap is stylish.  The holes are well sealed so they should not fray but I don't think you could add your own holes. The buckle is metal but slightly lighter than I expected - still it should be strong enough.  Although the band is 9.5 inches (24 cm) not counting the buckle there are no holes for the first inch so it only just fits my 8.5 inch (21.5 cm) wrist., Awesome watch arrived quickly, I wanted an outrageously styled and colorful watch. Boy did I find it., Love the watch, back light is bad but you learn to deal with it. Looks great. Directions came in Japanese so I went onto UTUBE and watch a video. Very durable I'm in law enforcement and have slammed it a couple of times dealing with bad guys and not a scratch on it.giving it 4 stars because of the back light., The watch appears nice and is a copy of what we saw on your site being advertised. But it is for a gift; and then again it takes time for the owner to use it and get back to us after  a while as to if it was a good watch and worked out well, or it was junk. Please give these item time for evaluation., This replacement band is not as comfortable as the original that came with the watch. The finish also is somewhat disappointing with excess flash around the openings where pins go. Would not purchase again., The watch indicates it is &#34;Indiglo Night Light&#34; but pressing the A button or the Crown does not turn it on.<br />How does it turn on?<br />Both the hour hand and the minute hand are very narrow and it is difficult to see in low light., Excelent for the price., This is a nice looking watch but I had to send it back.  I'm just an average sized person and it made my arm look like a stick.  Way to big for my taste., All titanium, eta 2824 movt, 2 butter soft silicone straps, watch winder- at less than $200. I'm not kidding., Sucks, Extremely Poor Quality product!<br /><br />I received one and thought all was fine.  A few hours later, it had stopped.  I tried to reset it and both hands moved together.  I pushed the stem back in and the second hand tries to go backwards occasionally and the other hands don't move!<br /><br />I contacted JewlreyWe asking for a replacement.  By the end of the week, I had the replacement.  That one is even worse!  From the get-go, it would not set.  I pull the stem to set it and the hands don't move.  I push the stem back in and the hands now spin around the center loosely as I shift the watch.<br /><br />I contacted again, this time asking for a refund.  Instead, they're sending me a 3rd one!  Will this one be any better?  Two absolutely total wastes as a watch -- what are the chances?<br /><br />At this point, I have two little velvet bags, two nice chains, two batteries, and two little owl-shaped paperweights!  They said I didn't have to send them back.  Note -- the little velvet bags do NOT have &#34;JewelryWe&#34; printed on them.  The description is wrong there.<br /><br />Update (9/12/15) -- I did get the third one and despite JewelreWe saying they ship from MA, it shipped from China.  However, it did finally work!  It has a visible flaw in that it looks like the owl is crying!  I have corrected the problem because of the two previous non-working owls.  I removed the big screw in the back from this and one of the other owls and swapped the eyes!  Again -- more work on my part but I finally -- after over 3 weeks  - got a working and pretty owl pendant watch., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, All was as expected! Thank you., It's a real good watch, with great features (love the snooze).<br />Looks good too with it's low signature overall appearance (no visible markings about this or that).<br />However, that inverse display is awful !<br />Impossible to read the time !<br />With sunglasses in broad daylight - forget it (get your glasses off !)<br />In broad daylight, tilt that watch till you can read something ...<br />In low light, don't even try, just press the illuminator button.<br />Whilst driving the car and just wanting to know what time it is, just look at the car clock.<br />It's a real pity ... because otherwise I love it.<br />It would be perfect if it was as it is with as the only change a normal display (not inverse).<br />Got myself a G-9000-8V which is the same watch, but with a normalish display (orange) and a sand color - very neat and I can at last read the time !, Do not purchase the watch!  I tried numerous times to get this watch to function and could not.  I then realized there was no resource for support.  I have returned the watch and I recommend you not invest the time and money that I have., Band was scratched and looks like someone tried to fix it with a sharpie..., This is beautiful and heavy weight. Great quality. It's very unique and has wonderful detail. Love this piece, will definitely order from this buyer again!, Nice looking watch, large but good looking and comfortable to wear. Very noticeable, love how it looks with included leather bands!, I suggest you do not waste your money on this ,bracelet was broken in less than a month  i use., Always getting complimented, AWESOME, I just rec'd my Bessky watch and it's nicer than the $50 Timex digital I replaced. It has a very large face and is very easy to read. It looks like I paid $50 + for it. I was hoping it would be this nice but really didn't expect it.  For $5.68 with free shipping I will replace this as required without a care for the cost. I set the time/date etc. and tried the stop watch without referring to the directions that came with it. Very intuitive to set up. Stop watch with lap time very easy to useTHIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE IN MORE THAN A YEAR.<br />TONY B., I like the large number display its easy for me to see at night and for the money it's a pretty good value compared to other brands I like it., It's a very nice watch band. Good leather and is well made.  This should last a long time., As a former Rolex owner (GMT Master) for 35 years, I have been very surprised by this Stuhrling watch.  Yes, its' a quartz watch, not a chronograph, the band isn't as heavy duty, as the Rolex was, but still this 824.01 is very attractive and is working well.  Compared to a $3k watch with a $250 band, this is a good alternative.  Very pleased with it., Nice size, fits oversized watches very well.  Attractive looking case!, A fun watch with a retro look!  Love this watch, highly recommend!, Absolutely beautiful!!!, Watch arrived without tags and was yellowed in color. I bought a new watch, but it looks used. Less than pleased with it., Excellent product!, All perfect!, This is funny story. The package it came in smelled like leather and the watch says Polo and looks so Expensive. I had to go recheck to make sure i paid $9.99 and not $99.99. I thought i might have made a mistake. I didnt. In fact there was not saying it is not affiliated with Raulph Lauren. Ive gotten compliments on this watch. To me its worth $100. I love it! You will too if you like gaudy. Once i thought i broke it because it fell on floor and a piece came off, but it was a piece for in case you want to adjust it and make it bigger or smaller., Excelent..., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one., Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., I love this design was so excited to receive it , but when I got it it didn't work. I returned it very disappointed., I will start from the shipping, I got the watch a day after Amazon scheduled the delivery day. Still it was kind of fast 5days. The package where the watch came it was an envelope And a zip lock bag with no instructions. but still no damaged to the watch! Now the watch, is a beautiful and awesome watch the materials are the same used by the big brands! The day after the delivery I used the watch and got compliments from many people! One guy even said to me &#34; hey awesome hublot wish I could afford one&#34; lol. When I got home I Checked hublot website and they look exactly the same as this watch the only difference is the price hublot 34k and this watch 34dlls!!! If you thinking about buying this watch please don't just buy it I highly recommend this watch is really really nice and for the price is just an awesome deal I just bought two more! If I could I will give more than 5 stars! Happy shopping!, This was the perfect choice for a replacement band for my Samsung Gear Live watch. I did have to notch the pin placement however that was easy the band not only works well it looks good as well. Very happy with this replacement., The metallic material is plastic. I really like the background lighting though, the colors help separate the digits and letters. This has lasted me for almost a year now, even after swimming in pools, running in the rain, and showering. Anyone who wants a waterproof watch for cheap should look at this one., Really pretty and cool watch.  My 10 years old love it.  Has multiple functions as chronograph, alarm (you can set 3 different alarms), light and it is water resistant ... it's a bit tricky to remember the order to press the buttons to program it.  Loved the color., This item needs a LED light to indicate when the item is on.  No visual to tell when on or off., Watching arrive on time and it is nice as I was expecting, Just the right strap and they included a second strap for free!, Looks good. Very easy to read even at night. Somewhat larger face than I thought by picture, The watch band fit nicely with my watch. It doesn't come with the two metal pieces/rods that attach the band to the watch. But you can use your old ones. You'll need a very small screw driver or small pocket knife to remove and replace the two metal rods. They are spring loaded so they compress.The thing about the band that kept me from rating it higher is the color. I expected it to be darker than it appeared on the web site. But it is still OK and very functional., Was perfect for putting the backs onto watches after changing the batteries.  Very easy to use.  Already used it on 3 watches., Incredible watch!  Very high quality and solid.  Looks and feels like a multi-thousand dollar watch.....seriously! Nothing about this watch is cheap. Everything: clasp, band, movements, dials, buttons, detail, even the box.....etc is amazing. Beautiful emblem engraving on the reverse.  Exceptional watch. I wouldn't be surprised to see Jiusko as a top-tier watch seller very soon!, First, the pros: This is a nice-looking, automatic movement watch for much cheaper that you can usually find. It's styled after the Rolex Submariner, and it can be worn causually or dressed up. The blue dial and bezel are the perfect shade - bright and colorful without being garish.<br /><br />But, it can't tell time. I've set it repeatedly, wearing it to ensure it was getting wound, and it's consistently fast, sometimes by as much as several minutes after a single day. You had ONE job, watch!<br /><br />I have trouble even calling it a watch because it's useless for telling time. I shouldn't have trusted a company who has a watch (distinct from this one) in their &#34;Pro Diver&#34; collection that can't even be taken in the shower!, Beautiful watch, very light, comfortable and classy. Great size face. I love  wearing it, I can recommend this watch. High quality and it has performed as advertised. A couple of things that might not be right for some. One it is a heavy watch. Two it sits on your wrist higher than other watches. Also because of the metal band you may needed to remove some links, as I did. If you have a thick wrist, the band does not come with extra links, should it fit you too tight. Again rated 5 stars for my use., Heavy, large, beautiful, Beautiful watch!, It's hard to set it and the buttons no longer work on it after a week, I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Beautiful watch ... Fun but still elegant wonderful color much prettier in person  and wow do those crystals Around the dial sparkle., Watch works very well., Beautiful watch, receive compliments all the time, The previous version was streamlined and had a flow from maid body through band. This version has a bit larger body and band is not as heavy and feels a bit cheaper.<br /><br />Technical functionally is great., Loved it. Came really quickly. Very functional. Little tricky to set up date., I like the look of the watch and the fact that I don't need to buy batteries for it and that it is water resistant makes it a good purchase., I love my watch it's exactly as pictured. A boyfriend style watch with the copper/rose gold accents., This clock is pretty. Recommended., Just awesome! Ive been after this watch for about 3 yrs and i couldnt find it. When i saw it on Amazon again, i just had to have it. I also own the mod 9937 and ive been very happy with it. They both have a swiss movement, that is why its more expensive than japanese movement counterparts., Excelent!, Beautiful !!!!!!!!, Nice looking watch.  A quick wind and it goes for 24 hours.  Keeps great time.  No instructions, so no idea what the other dials or buttons are for, but it tells time so I'm happy.  If and when it quits, I'll look for another., Have a timex expedition watch.  Liked it and the band it came with.  After a year of heavy duty wear the band got caught and ripped loose from the watch.  I thought I would have to buy a new watch.  Ordered this band which looked similar first and I'm glad I did.  It's better than the original in comfort and works the same.  Even if it only lasts a year I am still money ahead., Awesome!., item is beautiful and you will get many compliments but the reason i gave it the rating i did is because the time does run slow, and it looks like there is some specks of dust of something in the actually encasement its self!, My daughter loves it. When I asked her if there was anything she liked/didn't like about it she said &#34;I like that it has butterflies, but I don't like that they don't come to live and play with me.&#34;<br /><br />So there you go, perfect watch unless you're a 6-year-old with unrealistic expectations., I love the watch!!! However I only received the white one. Who can I talk to about not getting the black one delivered, Beautiful!, Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., It came rusted. Do not buy this watch!, Amazing..., The blue faced diamond accented Armitron watch is very pretty!, As a watch person, I really love this particular model. I didn't want to take my Tag watch to school, so I bought this as an alternative since it really resembles the Rolex Submariner. I've got many compliments from people, most of them assuming it was an actual Rolex. So if your looking for a nice watch that isn't too heavy, stylish, and won't break the bank, than this is it. I already plan to purchase another one in a different color., Very nice for a solar watch, i've had plenty of watchs that were a bit better but i would buy this again worth every penny, i dont like it, Strap is great quality but the design is flawed. The loops for turning the strap back on itself are too near the buckle, meaning the tail of the strap sticks out a lot. I have a luminox branded nato strap on another watch which is much neater and more comfortable., Bought 2 (4 months apart) and neither is water resistant.  The description says water-resistant to 165 feet; the pool is 10 feet deep.  After the kids wore it the pool several times, the inside fogged up and the buttons became difficult to press and sometimes unresponsive.  Timex will replace it - if you ship it to them ($) and include $8 for return shipping and they recommend insuring it in case of loss during transit...  for a $15 watch.  Shame... my kids really liked the watches too., As expected!, It's a nice looking band (once I finally got the right thing- my order was wrong three times before I got the right product), but the coat of plastic over the top of it is already coming off after 2 weeks or so of wear.  I don't think this will last long.  But it does look good., love the design and style - awesome, Its OK.  The fit is good and worked well for a few months.  Now the light no longer works and the entire watch resets occasionally when the mode button is pressed., very military looking and functional, When I first saw the watch, I was so happy not until I discovered that the watch is not working, I was so disappointed, and the seller is something else, they said I have to send the watch back with my own money when the fault is theirs, it's very very unfair,, Works like a charm., Worn once and the silver disappeared underneath the band in 2 hours time. Looks beautiful on here and when it arrived a month after ordering it. Too bad it was only beautiful for 120 minutes., Nice quality ,comfortable to wear . The hands  are however small and with the dark grey background  it is somewhat difficult to quickly glance to see the time., Excelente!, Fit the watch with out problems. Nice color. Good price.  But the leather was thick enough that it rubs against the watch side causing the leather to have small tear where it rubs., I have only had this watch for a week but it keeps to-the-second exact time, at least in reference to my cell phone's time.  The compass is reasonably accurate, but I still need to calibrate it, so assume it will perform even better afterward.  All in all I am very happy with this watch so far., very sheik, Really I'm surprised  it's a such wonderful watch from timex I liked this model is unique and stylish, This watch is AWESOME! Very well made and after many years of use is still as good as when I bought it. Many compliments on the orange face too., There jewel missing from the interface may be form shiping, To heavy., The rectangular shape is very nice.I have received  several compliments on the watch.It is hardier to read in lower light because of the darker face and lighter numerals.You don't also want to push the light button to check the time., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Great watch only had it a couple of weeks but I am satisfied. Looks nice and appears to be durable. This version with the black case and olive leather strap is for casual dress which is what I wanted for work and everyday use. The other styles would be more for dress I think., I have it over a month now seems awsome no sound great quality would recommend it. The gift gloves are too small in size should be a medium size, Band broke in two days the pieces are cheap., Piece of junk, I have owned this watch for two weeks so far. The watch itself (case and crystal) is very nice and machined well with polished surfaces. It was much thinner than I expected and sits well on the wrist. The bezel does not click and rotates with some effort-- but it looks good enough. The watch face has a nice metallic black finish and some contrast between the middle and outer edges. The lume on the hour markers does not last very long but the lume on the hour and minute hands last through the night (dim).<br /><br />The band is quite cheap and is made of hollow links but is quite comfortable on my wrist and lightweight. I ordered a replacement band when I placed the order.<br /><br />I am still measuring the accuracy of the movement but out of the box it gained approx 4 minutes over 7 days (~34s a day). However, after I opened up the caseback and adjusted the balance the watch is holding time pretty well (still measuring, but I will update).<br /><br />Overall, for the price this watch has tremendous value. I really like the no-nonsense design that works with hydro-static pressure and there is just something about the unique and classic look of this watch. Not to mention the price!, Great watch, nice deal, works perfectly...exactly what i needed. Recommended., Excellent feeling on my hands, as expected ., Really gorgeous watch!, This watch is more impressive in person than just looking at the photos. Very well made mechanical movement, elegant, yet simple retro design with a 40.5mm case. Slightly more than a typical dress watch but not oversized to retain that classy look. The band is a thick leather, embossed with a faux croc pattern that is slightly stiff and needs to be broken in. But it is a quality leather band. If you are looking for a simple but elegant dress watch, I would highly recommend the Bambino, especially at this price!, I love this watch i have ordered about 5 different Invicta watches from Amazon and i have never regreted it. I do struggle with gauging the size of the watch and this one was smaller than expected. It's a more petite feminine style vs the big boyfriend style watches. The only negative thing i can say about it is the mother of pearl looks more like just a white background you have to look very carefully to see some differentiating of color that you could be called mother of pearl. I was a little disappointed with that part only., It's perfect! Must buy!, I bought the watch knowing that it was not the best quality....Looks good but is not overly self-winding.  I have to wind it everyday so I guess the self-winding is just to maintain through that day. 3-30-16 UPDATE: Link pins are now coming out.  This is my dress/work watch so no I'm not scaling mountains with it on.  I have had better success with my &#34;drugstore&#34; watch that cost 10 bucks!   Down to 1 star.  Not worth the money at all.....would make a great paper weight though!, Different, Sweet, Feminine!  A little hard to see the time due to the &#34;busy&#34; pattern but I buy a watch more for the Jewelry effect and color coordination!!, The watch looks great and seems really well made.  I like the subtle blue hue to the face.  The bracelet snaps very positively and feels secure.  Good heft and size to the watch.  The only thing that knocks a star off is that the hands are hard to see because they are polished and unless the light is hitting them the right way they tend to blend into the face., WORST ITEM IVE EVER PURCHASED!!!! All of the watches broke the first time I put them on, I should have expected that for the price. But in this case I definitely did not get what I paid for, I GOT WAAAAY LESS !!!!!! NO STARS AT ALL, The watchband is exactly what I was looking for., Terrific!, I bought this as a present, and have been told that very acceptable and exactly what was wanted. It's very bright too, Very bad<br />Eager leakage and it is not water resistant, This watch has it all.  The basic features you expect (timer, stopwatch, multiple alarms, etc.), plus atomic sync, solar powered, and a nice backlight.  On top of that, it looks great and is very comfortable.  The size is a little bit big for my taste, but is still reasonable for my 5'9&#34; 170lbs body.  I really wanted to like this watch, but there is one major issue that caused me to return it.  The display is just too small, especially for such a big watch.  My main digital watch for the past 10 years has been the standard issue Timex Ironman 30-lap, and the display on this Casio is about half that size.  I'm a middle age guy with good eyesight, but I want my watch to be easy to read, and this Casio just falls short on that.  In the end, if you can tolerate the small display, this is a brilliant watch., A beautiful timepiece worthy of the Seiko name. This watch has the quality of a much more expensive brand get does it all for less money., Beatyfull, Update on 8/4/16 - the watch stopped working (battery) on 8/3/2016 which is less than a year after purchase (8/19/15).<br /><br />I bought this based on another product experience - [[ASIN:B005DRE6UU Invicta Men's 1431 Sea Hunter Black Dial Rubber Watch]] it has issues when wearing for extended period of time.<br /><br />Issues: Strap breaks, second hand stops and the two brackets to keep the strap in place break off. Also because the watch has a second hand +date the time will eventually slow down, so the correct time will not be kept. This is a design fault.<br /><br />The silver 1431 watch looks better on your wrist than the 1432.<br /><br />Still... it's okay for everyday wear., Watch Face smaller than expected but dope watch. I love it. And I don't know what these other 'reviewers' are talking about because the band is very comfortable., It is so big,the watch is not suitable for me., excelente, Awesome watch for an awesome price at the time. I got this for my son's grad gift. He loves it. Shipping was prompt., Got wrong watch, it was just what I was looking for, fore my wife, I bought this red watch for my daughter's birthday. I opened the box and it is PINK! Not her favorite. I'm not sure where the problem truly lies. The only problem is the color., Still trying to figure out all of the settings., It’s a good watch band. I changed the original band on my diver watch and it complements it well. The materials are nice, both, the metal pieces and the nylon., I love this tiny watch since I like black and it's very delicate. Suitable for little bit thin wrist., Not an OEM band. Yes, this band says Seiko and is sturdy, but is sturdy to the point where I have found it uncomfortable for constant wearing. The band is not near as soft and pliable as the one which came with my original Black Monster watch. It looks vey similar, but again is not the original., It's cute. It's fairly lightweight. Makes a charming keychain. The watch, which is what it was bought for is not as charming. The hinge is awkward and hard for my mother's hands to operate. We've had it only a few months and already it is no longer keeping time. Could be the battery but that seems doubtful., I absolutely love this watch. It's casual enough to wear daily and dressy enough to wear out. Perfect :-), Nice watch. I returned it as it was small on my wrist., Didn't realize this came from China. There's a reason it was so cheap - it's kind of crappy. Watch face came cracked., My husband LOVE it, I will definitely buy more in the future different color of course., Watch works as described. I only wish the dial used luminous paint for the numbers and hands. I like the watch alot., Love this watch and many compliments on the large face, I like this Timex Expedition watch a lot. The Indiglo feature means that I can now read my watch in the dark. My old Timex not only kept the exact time for more than 10 years but was still waterproof till the end., Face is too small. Need glasses to read time. Item returned., I didn't order the pins so I haven't had a chance to attach it to my watch yet but the look and feel of the band seems good.  It's a plain watch band, no designs at all.  the pictures are misleading.  the &#34;designs&#34; are on the underside of the watch band.  when attached, the smooth, plain side is showing.  at first I wasn't happy about that but I think it will be fine.  the texture and materials are perfect tho., I like it very much \u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a, The time on the watch goes faster than normal time so I have to keep changing it and it's hard to see anything on it during the day (practically impossible when you're running.), I like this watch so far.  I've been a fan of Seiko watches but last year decided to  try Fossil as highly recommended by a Macy's staff due to frequent hand washing for nurses.  I was hoping not to have the replace the battery every year as needed by my previous Seiko watch and have to deal with the poor watch sealing after battery replacements. I was wrong.  The battery in my Fossil watch died within a year.  I took it back to Macy but they refused to fix it because I've misplaced my receipt and Macy could not find the  online receipt either. I ended up taking it to a jewel store for battery replacement.  It worked for approx a week after the battery replacement but died again, probably due to the poor sealing of the watch by the jeweler.  I did not want to spend the extra money to send it back to Fossil for repair either.  I did some checking and decided to try this Seiko solar watch since the solar Seiko watch i've bought for my husband several years ago still work. So far it has been working great.  The face and numbers are large enough to read and the red second-hand allows me to count heart and respiration rates incrementally well.  I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because the date and the day of the week displayed on the watch do not always match and will take some time to get them to display right. I am happy with my new Seiko solar watch., Sent as a gift.  No instructions though, on how to set the date/time.  Figured out the time on our own, but not the date., This is a quality tool kit that will pay for itself many times over again through usage.  It has everything you would want for the DYI man.  My husband has a collection of watches and is a craftsman in another trade so he is picky about his tools.  He was delighted with this purchase.  The price is deceptively low.  I truly was not expecting the quality that I got., Looks great, the band on the black version actually looks somewhat brown. If you have a small wrist this is not a watch for you, you will have a few inches of extra band sticking out and catching on your shirt and stuff., Arrived earlier than we thought. My son is happy to have it. Easy to wear and to adjust the time. Fits well in his little arms. Overall happy with the product., broke as soon as i got it, I'm always a little skeptical when there's a big difference in price between products, after all, you get what you pay for.  In this case, this watch band is more than worth the price paid. I replaced a Citizen watch band, and this band is just as comfortable and a little more stylish than the original.  I highly recommend this product., Dead battery.  Sent it back for another of same model and the next watch came. Guess what. ANOTHER DEAD BATTERY., Really fun looking and iconic alarm clock at a reasonable price for a Star Wars fanatic!  Clock works just fine as does the alarm., Easy to install and exact replacement, Very cheap quality....I should have gone by the price to know how cheap it would be. It is huge on me and I cannot find and pins to remove in order to remove links to make it smaller. For some reason it came with 2 of the same watches...I only ordered one. Although, I do like the way it looks., too bad a little time after no working more, The watch was massive. I took it to a jeweler and had three links taken out. It was okay for two weeks, and then broke. I think the screws were just poor quality., The strap is a bit more maroon than red, but a great color overall. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., I like the watch.  Had to take it to a jeweler to have it sized, as we couldn't find a screw driver small enough to remove the screws.  The watch is very comfortable and easy to read., I am extremely pleased with the product., Bad quality. Stop working within a week after I got it., My eyesight isn't great, especially in dim light. I really like everything about it. The large black face with white numbers and hands makes it so easy to read. The Indiglo light makes it perfect for me. The style, with an adjustable leather band, contrasting white stitching and silver color casing, is very appealing. It was more than $10.00 below retail. At $36.99 you can't beat the value. To me, Timex has always been one of the most reliable and durable brand on the market. I don't need an expensive watch for a status symbol. I just want an attractive watch that tells me the time accurately and is dependable. Timex still makes a great watch at an excellent price., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one. But this one again, is awesome!, The quality is wonderful and it's stylish., Simple but cool., This is my 3rd versioon, It is cheap and I didn't expect a lot. But my question is: is it a male watch? The bracelet is a little too short for my hand and my arm. Half centimeter longer should be enough to fit comfortable, I ordered this watch on ebay but it had to go back due to a defective date wheel. The unscrupulous seller tried to say I didn't align the 24-hour dial with the main display but I did. Despite the inconvenience I learned that I really loved how this watch looks and wanted to replace it ASAP!<br /><br />Anyhow, over a month in to the one I ordered on sale from amazon and I couldn't be happier. It keeps excellent time, losing only one-minute every 4-5 days. The date wheel works as it should, and the compliments keep pouring in.<br /><br />I can't afford a $26K Hublot with industrial rise gold appointments, but this sub-$200 Diesel has to be one of the best values around. I love its sculpted dials and the large display is easy to read, along with luminescent accents when the lights go out. The leather band is glove soft and I do believe that this will last me many years. I like the chronograph option too and am getting used to using it for various applications.<br /><br />All-in-all, a killer watch! Highly recommended!!!, Not please with  it, For the price, looks fine., If you are looking for a basic Casio watch that looks like a G-Shock, but is a more reasonable size, this is the watch to get.  The only reason I returned it is because I was between sizes on the band.  It was either too loose or too tight.  Otherwise, I would have kept it., I love it.....I can actually read the numbers!!, JUST AS DESCRIBED, Very light., Comfortable Band, Easy to Wear.<br />I work night time hours outdoors and have been looking for a solid watch that I can see at night and that I can depend on.<br />This watch is Simple, Straightforward, Rugged and Dependable. I almost feel like buying a second one so that if something ever happened to the one I'm wearing that I would have a replacement ready to go.<br />I don't usually give anything a 5 Star Rating....but this Luminox deserves it.<br />Great Piece of Equipment., not fair to ding the watch as other reviewer did because it is too big for him...it is lightweight and a super watch., They work like they should., Perfect, it doesn't work, dissapointed, What a nice and simple watch. after adjustment my wife like to were it out when we cruise, For a very inexpensive watch I was pleasantly surprised! Construction was solid.  Band feels cheap and lightweight and appears to be like aluminum but so far holds up well. It is an automatic but also has a mechanical winder as well.  For $15 dollars you can't go wrong., Nice watch! The color of the band and body aren't common so that's pretty cool! The watch itself is pretty heavy so it seems like pretty good quality.  I got it on sale for less than 80 bucks so that was a great deal!, We bought this as a birthday present for my father-in-law and he loves it! Couldn't stop showing it off.<br />Very well made and does not look cheap which is always my fear with gold tone watches., excelente, Fine watch,, but can not hear alarm..., A beautiful, supremely functional time piece.  It does take a while to charge, but if you take the time to follow the instructions in the manual, you get to watch it setting itself, keeping time perfectly, and impressing the onlookers with its heavy, functional construction and function., BEAUTIFUL ,, This watch is more beautiful in person than it is in the picture.  I love the royal blue color.  I love the big face with all the big and small lines for the numbers.  This makes reading time easy which is important to me.  The hands are glow in the dark.  The wristband is skinny making it feminine looking.  By the way it looks, you can tell that it is a good quality watch.  This watch is perfect for me., After few month paint started peeling off!, I have bought 8 of these as a gift. Their Solar. You can swim with them. Light and double hour. Get it!, Works as expected but very loud clicking noise., We bought this watch for our daughter and she loves it. She's only 3 and can't actually tell time yet but she wears it all the time. Its nice that its waterproof and the band makes it easy for her to take on and off.And she was excited to the cool 3D texture. Good purchase., It was disappointing to me.  Perhaps it is the Color Combination???  I love Pink but it doesn't go with the trim color of the watch.  My Opinion!, I have never found a watch I like more than this one in terms of features and functionality, but over the years, the quality has seen a sharp decline.  I have found the need to replace it at least once a year, not because of the watch, but because the band inevitably breaks.  After reading several reviews with the same complaint, I contacted Timex customer service: custserv@timex.com.<br /><br />Timex replied the same day and offered to fix or replace the watch for $10.  They sent instructions along with a pre-paid mailing label so I could send the watch and check.  By the next week, I had a new watch.<br /><br />The inconvenience is a pain, but I was impressed with their customer service and am happy to have my tried and true watch back without having to purchase a brand new one., The band fit my watch LG RW watch perfectly.  It does give the watch a great look to it.<br />I tried to size the band myself but was not successful. I ended up taking the watch and band to a jeweler to have it sized. It cost about $12 money well spent.<br />Mike, The watch looks great and is as described. A bit smaller, than I thought (I actually thought I ordered a female watch).<br /><br />Cons: I do not like the stretchy band aspect. Catches my arm hair a lot, and can be quite painful., Doesn't fit a large wrist. Tells great time, easy to read., Zodiac is now one of the best brands I own. Apart from the watch being beautiful, well built and easy to read during bright light and at night; it's extremely comfortable to wear!! This is now my second Zodiac, I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, the package was open and the battery was dead! very poor way to sell a product., This my first ever automatic /mechanical watch that I have owned and so far so good. Great looking watch and the cost did not break the bank. I was somewhat apprehensive not being able to physically see the watch before I purchased it, but the price was favorably discounted compared to prices for same watch at department stores. Overall very please so far., the watch has met all my expectations, and is now my everyday wear!, I was not too impressed by the look and feel of this watch. Looks very generic and cheap. I was hoping for a better quality from Seiko - kinda disappointed. But thankful for Amazon's easy return policy - I was able to return it and get a full refund.<br /><br />The dial of the watch is very small. I usually wear a 42mm diameter watches but these are much smaller then the 42mm diameter watches that I have.<br /><br />Sorry Seiko, maybe next time., Excellent watch if you like the colors. Whether or not you like it will probably depend on personal preference really. But the material is fantastic!, If you are anything like me, you have been looking at some of the Casio Protrek watches, like the PRG-270 or PRW-3000.  No doubt, sweet looking watches with tons of great features.  However, those watches are either too big or too expensive, or both.<br /><br />Enter the SGW-100.  Almost the same features as its more expensive siblings, but at a fraction of the cost.  Also, the size is much more reasonable.  Not too big (and ridiculous), not too small.  And it has a real backlight, not the weak 1980's amber LED light that shines from the bottom left corner, like too many lower price Casio's., very beautiful, I thought it said made of wood in the description but it wasn't. One corner was not glues together. I had to return it., Ehh, wasn't crazy about this watch at all. Looks very cheap and cheesy but now that I have it seems silly to send it back, This watch stopped working in about 5 weeks., Face plate broke on my fiance after 2 days.  Horrible choice, Well built, everything you'd expect from a Swiss Army., gets broken easily, Cool watch. Looks more expensive than it is. This watch will look good with dressy clothing., Cool kids watch with unique layout for telling time., Junk! Went swimming in pool & watch filled up with water almost instantly. This happened on the last day (30 days) of warranty so no refund. :(, The watch is lovely but beware the bracelet.  It is very difficult to adjust unless you're a jeweler.  My husband (who is very handy) tried to remove some links and the strap broke very easily.  Pay to have a jeweler adjust the fit., Strap looks better in real life, love the watch itself!!!, WAY too BIG and awkward (size not obvious in the pictures)., I purchased this Casio watch a week ago to replace a much more expensive watch that kept giving me problems, first with water leakage, then with a faulty band.  It's a nice-looking watch with high-visibility numbers and hands.  Setting the time was easy, and it's keeping accurate time.  The band seems rugged.  I haven't done anything abusive to it yet, so I don't know how the crystal will hold up (the super-hard crystal was one thing I loved about my troublesome old watch).  The Casio does not have a screw-down crown to keep out moisture, but I've been wearing it in the shower with no signs of moisture problems yet.  So, all-in-all, I'm quite pleased with the watch, especially for the price.  I didn't give it five stars because, really, how much can you love a cheap watch like this?  But in terms of value for the money, it's definitely looking like five stars so far., The watch starting losing time almost immediately., I received my watch in a very timely matter and it was packaged better than my previous G-Shock from the store. I love every aspect of this watch. It's great for my job and stylish enough to wear outside of work., Amazing, outstanding, and beautiful watch!<br />All I have to do is get a link or two taken out., The strap of the watch was cut after using the watch for only 2 days<br />Don't buy this watch, I can't really personally give a review here because it was a gift for my boyfriend. He's a watch collector though with some pretty expensive taste (his next &#34;reasonably priced&#34; watch that he wants is over $3,000). He loves this watch and wears it at least once a week., This watch will not allow for second hand setting.  Two other watches were sent and they too could not set second hand.  Just be aware that these Seiko watches are not made in Japan!, This watch is awesome, it's a high quality design. The product arrived 2 weeks earlier than estimated., This watch was enormous on my wrist. I will be returning it. I like the looks of the watch quite a lot, but just too big,, That's too bottons not working. Only accesoris?, Very cute and durable, clock meets all expectations, Beautiful, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Beautiful watch and bracelet.  Not a bad color so it doesn't scream fake but the clamp is very hard to open so it's not that easy to put on., The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., I bought this watch for my girlfriend, she was so happy when I gave it to her, very nice I really recommend, Disappointed!  Boring due to same color on the band, the trim and he face!!, This watchband literally fell apart after 6 weeks of wear.  The leather at the connection to the watch started to pull apart, but before that part broke, the leather at the buckle gave way and the buckle fell off.  Since there was no way to repair it, it went in the trash., I had purchased one of these last year, but had dropped it and cracked the crystal. I liked the watch, sturdy but not large and thick like many pro divers. However, when I ordered another recently it came with a dead battery and I sent it back. That process went smoothly, but I decided to go another route., The blue is very dark, almost a black.  Not as light as the picture shows., This was a great buy and a beautiful watch, but I returned it because the face was really large, the band was very loose, and it's too &#34;flashy&#34; for wearing it with my normal wardrobe. I think if you were dressed up for a special occasion, it might be just right. It's hard to rate it with the stars, so I put three., Have had this watch for one week and am very pleased with it so far.  It is my first automatic watch and is more accurate than I expected.. I have been recording times with an app called WatchCheck, from Google Play Store, and over the last week it is only running fast by just over 6 seconds (an average of 0.9 sec/day per the app).  It runs slightly fast when wearing and slightly slow when off and laid vertical with 3:00 up.  They seem to cancel out very well.<br />It is very light thanks to the titanium construction.<br />I cannot comment on the water resistance of the watch since I have not exposed it to water, It does have a screw in crown that seems sturdy.<br />Some things I suggest for future models:<br />a) a larger luminous area on the second hand.  Hard to see in dim light.<br />b) better luminosity in general.  They are bright when you first go into a dark room but seem to fade fairly quickly, Basically, don't expect to wake up in the middle of the night and easily see the hands of the watch when it's on your nightstand.  There is some glow, but it is very faint, making it fairly hard for me to tell the time even when fully dark adapted. Maybe add red outlines on all the hands since the minute hand is much easier to see.<br />c) a domed crystal: this watch has a flat crystal and it does seem more reflective (see photo).  Have also read that domed are more durable, but I have not had any problems with durability of this one to date.<br />d) more watch band options:  I got the bund band and it seems it be of good quality and was comfortable but I also ordered a nato/zulu style band from Infantry Co., that I think looks sportier (see photo) and makes it less likely to drop the watch if a lug spring pin popped for any reason.  I will probably mainly use the nylon band.<br />Overall I think the watch is a good value (the other watches I had considered were Hamilton's that were considerably more expensive and did not have the screw in crown and therefore, were rated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.ated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it., Exactly what I was looking for, inexpensive, fast delivery., Beautiful watch, This watch SMELLS so bad you can not even wear it! Stinks like mildew. It looks ok but wasted my money on it because the smell is atrocious., Simply beautiful, far exceeded my expectations!!! Highly recommend it!!! Perfect for everyday wearing and goes with any attire!!! Very satisfied., (*Full Disclosure* I purchased this watch elsewhere on a TV network so this is a C&P of my review for it)<br />For a long time I was teetering back and forth from choosing this or the SAN Specialty mirror high polish gold/gold, but in the end it came down to me preferring the face of the SAN IV which imo needs no explanation, the line has many beautiful combinations all of which being due to the great cutout layering of the Swiss cross throughout the dial. Getting on to reviewing the watch, a piece that hopefully will once again be in stock and available for sale again lest my review be in vain.<br /><br />It arrived and of course it was immediately sized, and resized and micro adjusted a few times, yes this is a watch and bracelet design that can be challenging to those not familiar with large heavy watches with SS bracelets, it's all about finding that sweet spot and then it's smooth sailing. I emphasize this because proper sizing and simple micro-adjusts can make or break your watch experience. Depending on the weather or season my wrist can vary quite a bit, so I size it as tight as possible with the links and then I'm able to easily adjust the band in small increments.<br /><br />Next up is the finish, wow what a finish it is! If you have a little OCD as I do you may want to keep a soft polishing cloth in your back pocket,lol but I am serious, it gets smudged very easily. About the extra &#34;clear coat&#34; as I like to call it, it acts much like the nickname I gave it. When I closed the safety clasp it was very tight and after 30+ uses I was pretty amazed to see that the finish was still holding firm, not even a scratch. Normally a watch that has a matte finish or SS will likely leave a good scratch on the clasp where the safety clamps down, not the case here. I've worn it A LOT over the first month and did several of my own rigorous quality control experiments which is, if you don't know, extremely important when dealing with Invicta. While my haphazardnesshas etched plenty of very fine hairline scratches, none of them even came close to the depth of the actual gold finish thanks to the clear coat polish.<br /><br />Finally, after all of that 30 day break in, the movement and chronograph have been 100% functional and the time is within one second from which I set it to on arrival, month date and snapback day of the week all working just fine. The Ronda 8040N is easily my favorite quartz movement. As for the flash of the finish, yea it's loud and blingy, not everyone can pull it off, but you guys can sort that kinda thing out for yourselves. As for me I love it. This marks my 7th higher end Invicta I've purchased in the last year and a half, all of them Swiss quartz and over that time every single watch is within 5 seconds of what I set it too. The bottom line is that Invicta's design team has been operating at a level of intricacy and making designs that are unrivaled in their beauty and function(when they do function;)har har, and this piece is proof of it. I really wish they would attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye by boosting QC and CS, but until then they will leave customers weary, even people like me who have had nothing but positive experiences and collectors alike can't help but to hope to heck they don't ever need to deal with Invicta's CS for warranty service, but enough of that, they know what needs improvement and as long as I continue to receive quality timepieces I'll remain I customer of Invicta. Pictures included below. JD, PURCHASED FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES THIS WATCH! SHE WEARS IT ALL THE TIME!, Little on the large side for a women's watch. Keeping good time so far 4 rating due to size, I got this as a gift for my husband, and he loved it. It is a very big heavy watch, with a lot of buttons and features, but still looks very nice when he gets dressed up., The look and feel of the watch are all right. I love the hand-wind functionality. I encourage the maker and other watch makers to design and promote more watches that don't need batteries for the sake of our planet. I could be asked to makers of items that could work with energy coming from a hand winded source., Looks nice, but the ticking is really loud.  Edit: the dial broke off after a few months of use. I don't think I was particularly rough with it..., Gorgeous watch at a reasonable price. Very classy, elegant, and simple. The casing it comes in is also very nice!, Looks and feels like a fake watch, I bought this as a replacement band for a Pebble Time and it works beautifully. It's a perfect match for the watch color and functions exactly as specified. The only minor drawback is with sizing: it's virtually impossible for anyone without the dexterity of an octopus to grasp two tiny screwdrivers and exert enough force to be able to unfasten the links. I ended up using a Swiss army knife blade to prevent one screw from turning and then unscrewing the other with a watchmaker's screwdriver., Delicate and fashion, if the table shows the second hand,then it is perfect., Worst item ever purchased, not even worth a DIME!!! Broke the first time I wore it, fell right off my arm while I was wearing it,, Beautiful watch.  I own several Kenneth Cole watches in different styles, and this is one of my favorites.  The dial is easy to read and while I typically wear reading glasses,  I am able to read the day/date hands without them.  Besides a wedding band, watches are the only &#34;jewelry&#34; that I wear.  This one fills the bill as both an attractive and functional timepiece. The only negative comment I would share, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 relates to the description which indicates that this watch has a &#34;21-jewel, Japanese quartz analog automatic movement, with exhibition case back&#34;.  It is a Japanese quartz movement but does not have an exhibition case back, nor an automatic (self-winding) movement., Just as described....works wonderful...fast delivery as well ., I waited for a long time after placing the order, but in the end it all worth the wait.<br /><br />Very decent quality and packaging, especially considering the reasonable price., This is a fantastically well-made, quality product.  Easily the best watch band I've ever owned!  Except for the fact that when I sweat the band stains my arm . I guess whatever they use to stain the leather didn't set properly or something.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it five stars.  The black finish had started wearing off the hardware,  but that just gives it charm I think.<br /><br />Update: I bought this watchband on August 16, 2015. I used it for one year and seven months before replacing it. I've changed this review from 3 to 4 stars based on the durability of the band over that time. The hardware held up without fault, aside from the loss of color. Towards the end the leather started showing it's age by cracking and stretching. This is forgivable since this band only cost a surprising $11 at the time. Arm staining continued for a few months before tapering off with no lasting effects. Overall, this was a really great value and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others.<br /><br />(Last three pictures are after 1yr 7mths of use), it broke, I want my money back., I feel that I'm going to ask for a replacement because the glass you can see has some very little bruises which is unnoticeable and the product is very chique and classy., My husband and I got this for our daughter for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it!!  It is so cute and looks even better than the pictures!, But if you want to keep your watch looking like it has original parts, just spring for it.<br />I like the the watch, but the design isn't made for everyday., I have gone through a variety of Casio watches, and by far this is the best one I have ever acquired: Very sturdy, large font to see the time, the buttons on the sides require significant force to apply hence do not get pressed by mistake. The solar charge works very well; you can get it fully charged by placing it out in the bright sun one day (all day), after which just make sure to give it some sun on a regular basis (while wearing)., Just what I wanted!, Really beautiful watch. Big but fits very comfortably. Orange on silver/black a really nice combo., Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., The watch is fine.  I'm okay with it.  It's pretty much what I expected it to be, but it is NOT red.  The one color I cannot wear it with is red - which I have a lot of in my wardrobe.  The color is more like salmon.  There is pink in it.  Just disappointed in the color, but will keep the watch.  I like the watch., I've been wearing this watch for several months and I love it. It's a great weight and isn't too heavy. The face is striking and easily readable, with the mother of pearl adding a nice touch. I've worn it underwater many times while swimming this summer with no moisture leaking in. The bubble over the date took a bit to get used to, but now I can read the date without issues. Easily adjusted to the correct size for me. The clasp feels secure and I haven't noticed it opening at all. I have noticed a bit of the rose gold finish wearing off where my wrist rests on tabletops, but it's not noticeable to anyone but me. Great watch, would buy again!, Nice watch, however the buckle on the watch band broke when I first tried it on!!, Later on I don't know yet.....but right now it,s amazing and like this watch very much....that's I'm looking for they have date,day and month....., Stopped working about 24 hrs after I got it. Dead battery., Perfectly adequate traditional watch and band with date and handy Indiglo (face lights up with pressing on the knob) feature.<br />Cost is about 2/3 of buying in Target or other retail facility. arrived promptly as promised., Excellent, It looks awesome, but the time changes constantly.  I have to ask my husband to set up the correct time constantly., Not real heavy and the metal makes a kind of thin aluminum sound when it's moved, but it looks nice and for $5, I'd say it's just about perfect., It has already fallen apart!, Honestly, I think this is what a Daniel Wellington should cost...<br />Pros: lightweight (forget it's on) and simplistic (easily matches w/anything).<br />Cons: Thinness of whole piece (makes it look a bit cheap), No second hand (Could be a preference, but also makes it look lifeless mad cheap/broken) It just seems like Made in China is written all over it.<br /><br />Reason to buy: this is the best price out there, and the best part of DW is the easily interchangeable straps, I would suggest buying a couple of 20mm Nato straps to add some variety to this purchase ($5-15). Make sure you get rose gold though., Watch itself it neat, but the rods that hold the band on keep popping off., The colors, ease of use, and style of this watch are great. The size should be good for most people. I am a woman with slim/average sized wrists and wear the watch almost at its tightest. The watch is lightweight and fairly slim.<br />Negatives: The inner Velcro seam was itchy at first, but it doesn't bother me as much after a couple days. Also, the date isn't displayed on the face unless you press start/stop., Exactly as described. Fits the Apple Watch perfectly., it was just what I was looking for, This watch is even better than I'd hoped. Looks amazing and the quality out weighs the value by a great deal. Couldn't be more happier with my purchase. This is my first invicta but can guarantee, won't be my last!, very think strap, Simple and elegant design for the tightest of budgets. It's plastic so the cover will scuff easily, but a replacement is cheap!, One funky looking watch. Big face. Keeps good time...2 year warrantly., this is really good looking watch and i can give  5 stars just for the look and that it works well..... but there is a big problem with its band.... i just wore it for couple of days and it just teared up......so it deserves 1 star for it.........can not even find a new band to change it..........., This is a good watch for people who want something simple -- no alarms, no extra gadgets.  I've only had it a few months, though, so can't say how it will last., The SKX series are classic automatic watches and a great value.  These are the Kalashnikovs of the watch world - iconic styling, robust construction, but not terribly accurate.  Expect it to run +/- 10-20s per day and you won't be disappointed.  It can be regulated for much better accuracy - you can also learn to position the watch at night to make up or lose time as you need.  For me, that's part of the fun of an automatic.  It does not hack or wind if that's important for you.  Fit and finish is excellent in my opinion.  The case in particular is beautiful and you can easily trace it's evolution through an interesting lineage of Seiko divers back to the 60s.  My first (SKXA35) is still going strong after 10 years without ever being serviced (FYI it's marked mov't Malaysia same as the SKX173).  Even the Lumibrite lume and Hardlex crystal are like new.<br />I just bought this one for use as a daily 'beater' that isn't bright yellow.  I also really like the square indices, reminiscent of the old 6105 from my era...  The first watch that arrived had a misaligned chapter ring, bad enough my wife and kids could notice, so back it went.  The second watch is much better but not 100% perfectly aligned and the day/date sit low in the their window.  My wife and kids can't see it and think I'm crazy for insisting - so I kept it (but I know...).  For what it's worth, my old SKXA35 was/is perfect.  I don't know if QC has gone down hill or if I just got lucky on that one.  Anyway,  I do recommend buying 'Fulfilled Through Amazon' so you can take advantage of the easy returns if your particular watch doesn't cut it.<br />I might add that these are thickish watches at 13mm but wear well on smaller wrists.  Lug to lug distance is about 45mm, that's pretty short and I feel a better measure of fit on the wrist than diameter (42mm w/o crown).  I have a 6.25&#34; oval wrist and it feels fine and looks natural.  On a Strapcode oyster bracelet it feels wonderful and looks expensive.  On a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment., Its a bad ass watch., VERYYYYY GOOOOOD, Looks good and fits great.  It is thin, so I am not sure how durable it is, but it might be that I am used to the canvas style rather than the nylon.  I like how it looks on my Seiko, and will wear it as soon as I replace the battery (in my watch, the strap does not require one)., Product not as described - bezel is black not gunmetal like the face.  I live overseas and due to postage costs this is too cheap a watch to bother returning, but disappointed I didn't get what I paid for., I have to admit that iI wasn't quite sure I was actually going to get it first of all and that if I did if it was going to work well.<br />I'm  saying this because it was  ridiculous low price for the look that this product can give. surprisingly enough this watch works fine. except for the 24 hr  and montly indicators. they are stationary.  i though the metal part wast going to rust and change color, so far it hasn't .<br />good product for that price., A little small, excellent, Excellent watch and very fast delivery.  Very pleased, This is a very nice watch. I like to use it when I am working in the garden and in the kitchen. I don't have to worry about having to take it off for dirty work., This is my second G shock and it's really a cool one. It's a little more expensive than the main line of Gshocks but it more than makes up for it with its appearance. As others have said here, the colors are not pure orange and blue, but a tad washed out. The Japanese special edition has more vibrant color. I knew this before hand and chose this version as I think the colors stand out enough already to the point where you can't avoid seeing it and to go further would be a little obnoxious. It's big and colorful so it works well in places like dark bars, clubs, or anywhere else at night that isn't very dressy. The yellow roller on the side is a little overpowering on the watch but it adds a little childish character to the watch. It looks like something out of a cartoon or perhaps a nerf produce or a late 80s, early 90s watch. I will wear this over my Rolex when I'm out at night just because the colors can keep. Good buy and will easily last at least a decade like most Gshocks do., Really beautiful......., Took about a month to get here, but it's worth the wait. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it even glows in the dark :), Very disappointed with this watch, does not work.  I removed the pin and set the time and the hands never moved., Excellent watch! Does all I need it to do. Use the stopwatch often. Also temperature function. All easy to access and fairly easy to operate. Complicated! Just what I wanted for years., beautiful appearance I bought for my wife's 25th anniversary and it is worth the money, Really nice and sleek looking watch. The style and look is very unique and is very durable. This face of the watch looks very chic. Good value for the price. I have made this my every day watch, i wear it to work, a night on the town or a nice wedding it looks good in every situation. It is a very comfortable fit I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a good quality watch. This is already my second tmbr watch purchase and these watches have not given me any issues. Pick one up, you wont regret it., It's very nice and exactly what I expected. I already had a silver one., Ilike the look and feel of the watch. it is very easy to operate and I love the auto time setting., I absolutely love this watch. I don't like that the battery died a month after I bought it., I absolutely love this watch!! Thankfully there was no physical damage to the watch but it was loose in the box like it had just been put in there with limited care. I was a little disappointed when opening the box but thankfully the watch still had its plastic covering on the face to help protect it.  Overall, I was very pleased with the purchase. It even came in the Fossil tin. :), truly the perfect watch....classic in it's appearance, not too bulky, perfect size., Broke in two weeks, I never have to worry about the time again since its an atomic talking watch. Nice big numbers and it even lights up at night! I'll never want to go back to a regular watch again!, Excelent on time its that they offer. Elgant and finest, The lid of the box doesn't close properly with my Seiko SSC007 in it., Love this watch, very simple and straight forward. nothing to distract you when trying to read time., Not bad, not great. It takes a little getting accustomed to, though I am not a techie wizard. The only thing I would change is the digital display. It is dim until the light is turned on. It reads the temperature accurately and other functions seem to work well. It needs to have time to take it through my routine., very nice watch as I am an ESQ fan having owned a number of ESQ watches in the past... my favorite ESQ's  though have been and still are their Octane line of watches that they have since discontinued.. the Octane snap clasp rubber watchband is better for my needs than this standard band... this is overall a super nice watch though.. nice large numerals that are easily readable..great crystal quality..  still very happy overall with ESQ-Movado watches .. BTW I just purchased a 2nd one thru Amazon today 2/9/2016, Works well, have to say originally,  I could not tell the difference between the band that came on my citizen watch and this one. They have the same look, same thickness. This one was advertised as Leather, and while the back portion seems to be leather, the front (the part that everyone sees) is DEFINITELY NOT LEATHER...BUT VERY CHEAP VINYL. It has cracked and split to the point that after less than six weeks, I have to get another watch band. I have included a picture that shows how the band wore out over this time period and proves that it cannot be leather., Needed a battery operated, reliable alarm clock.  This one is easy to read, the alarm is loud enough to wake me, but not jarring or harsh. There's an easy-to-locate button to light the face if you need to take a look during the night., Its stylish as well as functiones great with quiet mechanism unlike my old Timex. I just wish it had a sweeping second hand option without having to keep the stopwatch feature turned on., Excelent!!!, It just wonderful. Best if you want to give as a gift., This watch looks nice, but it has a nasty tendency to spontaneously stop, because the opening mechanism is at the same location as the time-setting mechanism. I left mine in Philadelphia and didn't feel compelled to go back for it., My watch stopped working almost right away! Gumball machine quality., The Only problem is that the strap band looks inferior and is made of a low quality.<br />I just ordered for a new quality stray band replacement.<br />The band kills the beauty of this time piece., I love this watch!! I wanted something casual but nice and inexpensive. These weekenders take a classic look and make it totally versatile but allowing you to easily switch the bands with different styles/colors. :-), I got this watch because I always see  it posted online with rave reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't like the band initially, but it has come to grow on me. The watch comes with a ton of functions, I don't think I'll use them all except for the indiglo feature. On thing I was happy about was that this watch doesn't have the loud tick that so many Timex watches suffer from. I was able to snag this on sale, but I wouldn't mind paying full retail for this watch. If you are looking for a stylish daily driver, do yourself a favor and get this watch., fell off apart and i am trying to send it back to company., 10 points. everything was as expected, exactly products, Band fell off after wear it a while, Thought this watch too big for even me, a large watch lover. I think had the watch itself been somewhat thinner  and the band slightly more narrow I would have kept it as it was a beautiful color. As it was, I returned mine the same day I received it. But for those who love really large face watches, this one is great!, This box is beautiful and was a great gift! I took it to a local engraver to have my husband's initials added, which just added to the character. Love this!, The pictures don't really give you an impression of how big it is. THIS THING IS GIANORMOUS!!! Perfect if you want everyone to know that you are wearing a watch. But not really my style., That best buy ever, very comfortable nice fit goes with everything really glad I purchased like it a lot, The product as per the shipping agreement. The watch was packaged well. The only problem was the battery was just about dead. I had to send the watch to Nixon to have the battery replaced., you get what you pay for.  not the best quality.  would not buy again., If you're looking for a stylish and heavy-duty watch with an analog readout, check out Swiss Legends.  This watch has the same look as what you would see on James Bond.  Extremely heavy-duty, but stylish at the same time (no laser beams or decoders included that I know of though).<br /><br />I've had a number of watches, but this one is by far the heaviest I've ever owned (not just heavy duty, but it physically weighs a lot).  So if you like the feeling of knowing you have the watch on your arm, then this is a great option.<br /><br />The readout has a lot of settings.  There are stopwatch capabilities, including lap timer, multiple different time zone readout options, and date.<br /><br />It does take a bit of time (no pun intended) to learn how to use this sophisticated watch.  But once you learn the basics, it is fairly intuitive.<br /><br />Be sure you get the chronograph version (unless you enjoy regularly winding the watch, or you're prepping for an EMC and you want a watch that won't stop working).<br /><br />The only notable downside - the many readouts, and the instruction manual, are tiny.  My eyes are starting to go and I can really only read the &#34;big hand, little hand&#34; parts without the aid of eyeglasses.  Even the date is too tiny for me to read without eyeglasses.  So one star removed because of my aging eyes.<br /><br />Also, unless your wrist exactly fits this watch, you'll likely be taking it to a jeweler to get a link or two removed in order to size it for your wrist (but that's the case with any high-end watch)., this watch so far has been really nice. it fits comfortably, not big and bulky, easy to use perfect for work, this watch performs all the functions I need it to have it perform. It is inexpensive and durable. I'll buy another one when this one breaks., It's just like in the picture but would have appreciated if they offered wrist sizing, Not sure if it's even genuine. This watch can pass 12 two or three times before the date will change., hard to set time, etc. Even with the instructions was unable to set it.  Nice looking though, Love this watch. Face is easy to read and not too big on my wrist. Leather band is beautiful shade of blue and comfortable as well. Thanks for a great value., I like the style and fit but the clasp is installed backwards, it makes it difficult to clasp yourself so you have the have the made in china face outwards instead of Akribos., Looks sharp! The face is a bit big for my liking but my husband loves it and it was a great value for a nice &#34;dress watch&#34;., I've just received this watch 4 days ago and when I press the light buttom it goes like crazy, changing light colors and it doesn't stop.<br />I set the time and just one day after it had 45 minutes behind real time.  So, It definitely has a serious quality problem!<br />So, It's just a waste of money!, This is a cool looking watch without going too far, the stainless steel case is well machined and solid, the offset 10 O'Clock crown is knurled making it easy to grip while adjusting. A Sapphire Crystal is strong preventing scratches much better than mineral glass that you'l find in many watches in this price range.  This watch comes in a shaped ballistic nylon case that zips the clam shell case closed keeping your watch safe when not being worn. The second hand extends the full 12 to 6 O'clock length, half of the second hand is red so its easy to keep track of. The ribbed soft rubber strap is light and comfortable, its shaped at the contact points helping to keep it from rolling around on your wrist. No rubber smell emitting from this strap. The hour and minuet hands have blue/Green luminous markers, they hold a good glow for longer than most showing Oakley cared about the details., I used a push pin to remove links from the band, which was very easy. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., She likes the appearances, the fit and the feel time will tell if it's a fantastic watch., i have just received my hilfiger men's watch. it is perfect except that i cannot get instruction anywhere`order no. 701-2002682=7454662  it is a<br />tommy hilfiger men's 1710337.  please. i know that i am no quite in the rightn dept., Very pleased.  Beautiful watch and very fast delivery., Package arrived in time, product is excellent clock is working but a bit bigger than indicated in the picture, overall satisfied with the transaction., It's a good watch for the price. The watch band broke already, just popped apart., It stoped working 3 days after arriving..., very very nice finish , fast and easy to adjust !, I got it in a black plastic bag covered in tape. It doesn't tell the time. Its about a half second slow. It confused me for half the day. Also the strap broke as I first put it on. The gem stones instide the watch fell off on that one day I wore it. I guess it makes a good maraca..., works well, it is a bit difficult to program without the manual., I love this watch! It's so unique and I've gotten lots of compliments.<br /><br />Initially after ordering, I got a quick email with a shipping confirmation, and received the watch a few days later. It shipped inside a nifty little suede pouch with a button fastener, and I use it as a place to set my watch on my nightstand.  After I got it the first day and did a quick inspection, the watch was flawless with a really nice rose gold finish. The wood dial is stunning with the tmbr logo very tiny and understated. The crown clicks in and out precisely, and overall the watch feels like precision workmanship.<br /><br />The band is nice supple leather that breathes quite well, even when it's humid outside, and the buckle matches the rose gold watch case perfectly.<br /><br />This is all good news, because I'll probably buy another one. After a week of me wearing it, my wife decided she liked it so much that she claimed it for herself.  She has very tiny wrists, but I have to admit it looks great on her, too., Received quickly and will make a lovely Christmas gift!, It's prank, the worst item I ever bought from Amazon, I got it for my girlfriend on her birthday and withe two months it turns the colors which made me look like s***, wish I could give lower than one star also., Scrached to easy and if i would have known it was so heavy i would not have bought it., What a gorgeous watch!  I am a nurse and wanted an everyday watch to wear to work with some style.  This is it!  I have received many compliments already!, It's OK,very pretty. It it much too large for me to wear, but would look lovely if you like BIG watches., Exactly as advertised. It's the real deal. My pathfinder has seen some rough days, and the band was about to go. I expected to have problems with the screws, but aside from having to use knives as screwdrivers, the bolts came out and went back in easily, even though they were badly bent. That's the only downside to this product; it doesn't come with the screws, but it said that in the description. But the band is nice and legit. Nicer than my ratty old watch!, I like it!!, Is so cute .love it, Excellent value for this watch, for smaller wrist - best purchase price you could find anywhere, Strap too short and I don't have large wrists.  Loops keep migrating.  Other than that it does it's job albeit &#34;snugly&#34;.  For 12 bucks I'm being too fussy., Magnifique watch very sturdy very high quality 100% recommend use it everyday, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Fits the wrist very well and it's a cool watch.  Does not come with any instructions and it's pretty tough to set., I like this watch. It's got a retro look to it. I have a skinny wrist so the band is on nearly the tightest notch, but that's ok. The face is big but not overwhelming and the numbers are clear. The date is hard to read, but hey, I'm retired, so who cares what the date is!, Excellent replacement/alternate  watch, considering it's not a &#34;high dollar&#34; model.  I bought it as a back up to my other watch of the same type, and I was surprised to see it has a 10 year battery (didn't think that was possible; will see).  Anyway, the five alarms are nice to have, it looks nice; with decent sized numbers for me (eyesight's not what it used to be).  Nice color.  My other is black and silver this is as pictured, black and blue; which is cool, as I like both colors.  Nifty little inexpensive watch to have.  It includes manual, which the Casio Men's AW80D-1AVCB 10-Year Battery Ana-Digi Bracelet Watch did not, reviewed separately., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Wear it all the time!, Watch is exactly as it is shown in the picture..would definitely recommend.., Really large on the arm but that's what I wanted - thx!, This is a beautiful watch!, I receive many compliments on this watch once people figure out how to read it.  :0)  I am a lover of interesting, different watches and this fit the bill!  I am loving it!, Bought this as a replacement for my hubby's Casio watch. The original band had broken after 6 years of regular use. Perfect fit, and looks great!, Nice looking watch.  It had a little bit of glue on the face when it arrived but I took that off with some nail polish remover.  I just wish it could be adjusted smaller.  My son's arms are kind of scrawny., I instantly fell in love with this watch when I saw it. There is no doubt this is one of the best bang for buck watches available. Its not like the wanna be brands. Its well made by the people who know watches and it uses its own in house movement which everyone is talking about but ONLY ONE thing disappoint me that is Strap :((.<br />If strap is not a big deal for you as me, and want a good watch which people will admire and most importantly in your heart you know that its an original and genuine product, go for it. Its not about the money its about the value. Cheers. I highly recommend., Works as expected with a canvas band much more comfortable that what I expected.  Easy to read dial.  For $50 this is hard to beat., I really like it!!! I can't say anything bad about it...yet ( I have it for a week ), Excellent..., I got this watch winder in a bad condition (chipped at corners)and the reason; it was not properly packaged but regardless of physical issue the following were my concern too:<br />1- There is an option in the winder that makes the turn clockwise and counter clockwise every few minutes automatically which wasn't working (may be it was because of the not-properly packaged or throwing the package or falling down....)<br />2- On the description in Amazon add, it says glossy wood finish watch winder, so I thought it has a plastic face and glossy wood body, but actually the whole body is made by plastic and it is wood effect not wood finish. I think they should change the add to \\\\\"Glossy Wood effect\\\\\" because it makes confusion.<br /><br />I was not satisfy of the product, so I returned it!, Looks expensive unail you look up close and realize everything is fake., Awesome pc, Whatever.., This watch is just beautiful - not too bling-y because the crystals are tiny, but definitely a step up.  And I do like the tri-color - goes with my favorite pair of earrings!, I don't know what a standard woman's wrist is but this will not fit any wrist larger than 5&#34;.  Very disappointed!, Bought this for my dad. It has a nice large face and easy to read too. It also has a button to light up the face to see it in the dark., After a while (several weeks only) the water vapor starts condensing inside the watch. The watch stops working. Beautiful, but cheap and defective watch. Do not buy it ever!, I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it.  It is delicate and looks good on her.  She is on the small side and<br />it fit perfectly.  I think this is a nice watch for someone that doesn't like the really big ones that seem to be in style now.  This is a classic and<br />will always look great., I can't give it as a gift because the box is damaged. Very disappointed., Gave this as a gift and she liked it., NOT a Grand Seiko - do not buy at this price.<br /><br />Don't know if the poster realizes is, but the watch pictured is NOT a Grand Seiko., Works as expected, And low cost eliminates worries if lost or damaged., Movement powered. If I take it off for 1 day, I have to reset it. I bought it for special occasions to look nice. After setting it 4 times, I threw it away. Looks pretty. That's all. I will stick with my G Shock., Little knob to change the time wouldn't stay on or turn the hands correctly and knob was lost quickly., I could not get it to work.  The battery would not charge.  Returned it., I've been eyeing some Shinola watches recently but didn't want to drop $600 so I bought this watch, combined it with a light tan leather band (20mm Width Panerai Style Leather Watch Band from JP Leatherworks), and boom, it looks exactly like the $600 watch I've been drooling over. I love the big look of the numbers and the fact that they are luminescent. I've only had it a few weeks so can't comment on its longevity, but in terms of looks, this was perfect for me., Returned because it was so difficult to open the band. Have to put finger under the band to open.<br />Currently own a Guess watch with similar band - push tabs on the side & it springs open., Handsome watch, easy to set, but DH could not read the numbers day or night.  Had to return it., It is to heavy I used couple times and today I wanted to use did NOT Work. Was  a BAD investment  Was a Christmas gift from my wife I keeper I a nice yellow box. And does Not work, This watch face is lovely and a quality piece of jewelry; however, the band is nothing to write home about.  I am glad the price of the watch was low, because I will need to replace the band.  The band where it goes through the pins is just folded over and glued.  I'm afraid that with sweat or very much daily wear, it would come apart and the watch would fall to the floor and possibly break, or worse yet, be lost.<br /><br />Keeping time does not seem to be an issue, and the movement is smooth.  The design is what attracted me to the piece and it is truly lovely.  If you make this purchase, just plan on either not wearing it often, or replacing the band so you can wear it more frequently.<br /><br />I would still recommend this watch at this price point., Watch arrived on time (!) It's comfortable and easy to read. I had what may have been age-related difficulty setting it--crown hard to pull out and the date square is too tiny for me to see. Nevertheless it meets my needs, so I'm happy., The watch broke the first day I wore it., stopped working on batteries after a few  months, It looks wonderful, Everything was going fine, until today.  The watch month dial jumped to Nov. ( it's still Aug ) so therefore, the date is all messed up., The best for your money, Slow shipping, wrong item., AWESOME!!!<br />AMAZING!!!!!<br />The watch is unique at its price. Works well,looks so good on wrist,,I've been receiving compliments every day since I have this. It's a really great deal., I received this watch yesterday.  It is very attractive and classy but the face is pale gold and the minute and the second hands are pale gold so they blend each into the other and you just cannot tell the time.  This is a major fault in this watch.  I am uncertain if its the one I purchased or if its a fault in this type and style., Solid watch, though leather feels a bit fake., metal prong on latch broke off after a couple of days.<br />daughter loves the uniqueness of it and we're looking for a different prong to repair it., This thing is awesome. I'd never had an Invicta watch before, and certainly not one this large.  However, I've had it a few weeks and I've grown very attached to wearing it.  Until now it's only be Fossil and Timex brands for me.  The people I work with noticed it the very first day.  It's a large and in charge watch that also becomes a conversation piece when all else fails.<br /><br />I'd read lots of reviews from watch snobs who said the Invicta brand was cheap and didn't quite have the quality of watches that cost 5-10 times more than this watch.  I took all of that into consideration and I still purchased this watch.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'll be honest here, the reason I went looking for a better watch was because the watch I'd be wearing was so small compared to what my colleagues and management were wearing.  I studied the various sizes closely to make sure what I bought would fit my wrist based on my size and how I usually dress for work.<br /><br />Let me break it down a bit:<br /><br />Me:  5'9&#34;, large guy, 8&#34; wrist (possibly 8.5&#34;).  I wear a watch every day - at work and at home.  I don't dive, but didn't care - I liked the diver watches anyway.<br /><br />Initial impressions:  This watch is nice to look at and definitely catches the eye of others around you.  I'm usually not a &#34;flashy gold&#34; kind of guy but this is just enough to make a statement without looking like you are a rapper.<br /><br />Quality & Feel:  It's heavy compared to my other watches.  Larger, too.  It feels substantial on my wrist but I quickly got used to it being there.  The band is solid and has &#34;Invicta&#34; inscribed on one side and &#34;Grand Diver&#34; on the other.  It also has those porthole diver men on the north/south side of the face.  The crown sticks out a good amount.  The diver dial on the top is solid and clicks as you move it.  It's not flimsy at all - very sturdy.<br /><br />Movement:  I studied this a bit before purchasing.  The one I received had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.  Maybe all the newer models have that same movement - but I did read some articles where Invicta had been using a different movement in it.  Anyway, I like this automatic thing.  I wear the watch almost daily and it stays wound all on it's own.  Also, the underside of the watch has a clear window in it where you can see how it winds itself.  It's very nice and has a yellow part that swings about that has script writing on it.<br /><br />Setting the watch:  This was fairly simple.  I *did* have a problem figuring out how to set the date, but once I read the instructions (duh) it was fairly simple.  To save you time, you just unscrew the crown, pull it out one level (out of two) and dial in the date you want.  One note!!  I was an idiot and didn't pay attention to what time of day it was when I set the date, so I found the thing not changing the date when I expected it to, and then changing midday when I didn't want it to.  Since this watch does not show &#34;AM / PM&#34; , you kind of guess at the time of day when you set it.  Just move the clock forward 12 hours if yours is changing at the wrong time.  You'll figure it out.<br /><br />Sizing:  Ok, so even with an 8-8.5&#34; wrist, I had to remove links.  Ultimately I removed 4 links, but that made the watch a bit too snug for me, so I'll be adding one back in shortly.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this, or any other Grand Diver you happen to like.  I'm happy with it and considering the price point, I felt like it was a good balance between cost, quality, features, and style.eceived had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.

It was delivered just when Amazon said it would arrive and he was very pleased with it. The band however proved to be a little too tight as my son has a larger than average wrist.<br /><br />He contacted Seiko's customer service dept. and they quickly mailed him 3 additional links free. Only two were needed, but now he also has a replacement should one ever break.<br /><br />Seiko is a well respected brand, and their customer service reflects that reputation. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of their products again., The watch stopped. Too late to return to Amazon (past 30 days). Have written to the manufacturer but have not gotten a reply., As expected, This is my third citizen watch, first review. I will be keeping short and simple. There is nothing else you would want on a watch, it has all of the essentials without breaking your wallet. I see people wearing name brand watches that need their batteries replaced, some sub par glass materials, and you have to set the correct date every time the month falls short of 31 days and it's all for about the same price as this beauty. If youre looking for a classy time piece and don't mind the dual tone design this is your watch. You will not be disappointed. I gave it four stars due to the dual tone design,  other than that is a magnificent time piece., Looks a knockout! Dials not easy to read, My watch was one of the ones with very tight back that won't open no matter how many different house tools I try.<br />So I was worried if this little product would really open it, and guess what, it did  the job!, Watch looks great and is a definite eye-catcher except don't plan on getting even a drop of water on it.... ever. I wore it in a light drizzle and somehow moisture got locked inside the display and now the condensation blocks the display and is probably causing damage inside. I will be returning this and probably won't be buying Diesel again. For the price and the claims (water resistant up to 33 feet?) this is not remotely worth it. It's really a shame because this really is a good looking watch., Very nice watch for running because of the large display.  Good for &#34;old guys&#34; whose vision is no longer what it used to be.  😉, A little large, but very pretty, and lots of detail, Can't read the display due to glare. Seems like it's  from the high viz green face cause I have never had this problem on other g shocks., Great watch,however, it just doesn't go with the outfit I originally bought it for. Reason being is, it's a totally &#34;different color&#34; blue. I needed navy blue to go with my fourth of July outfit. Very disappointing. .., Perfect in every way, Nice, unique, and eye catching. Good quality, really like it!, My son loves his watch.  He has no problems with the band being too small (he is seven and the band is as tight as it will go) and he doesn't have any problem with it itching as some others have mentioned.  The hour and minute hands are labeled which helps him with learning to tell time., If you buy one oil... this should last you for a very very long time., Ok but too thin in width., Much bigger than the pictures make it look, and has a very wide band. So if you like that style I recommend it, cause it is very nice. Had a defect in the side so I'm returning it, I have the same watch in black, brown and red, and was looking forward to adding blue to my collection. However, this watch color is closer to black than blue.  I truly thought it would be a lighter blue than what I received.  I still love the Victorinox product just not the color of this particular watch., Stopped working after a week!, Distinctive, sturdily made clock. Brass numbers and map face can be adjusted to your liking. Easy to read face. Keeps good time., This is my favorite alarm clock., Prefect casual watch. Band a little thinner than it looks but works for what I needed., Love my watch ! Looks good , easy to read and use . Only thing i dont like is i dont understand how to use the alarm and sometimes when im working the buttons hits surfaces and against my wrist and start the stop watch or alarm or changes the time but other than that its perfect ! Yes it is waterproof !, ok, I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch band to be very well made, comfortable, and easy to adjust. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced, although it does not have a titanium bracelet.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., Works, All I needed was one 25mm spring. Could not find anywhere. Much easier to order and wait for it to arrive. Now have many spares. Good quality., Fast shipping. Accurate product info., I really love these watches. I've been getting so many compliments, and the best part is, they did not cost too much., Buyer beware. This is a Quartz watch not an Automatic. Made in China. Not Swiss made., I got my watch about a month ago. It was delivered on schedule and is as described. I love it and I wear it everyday., Many economically-oriented watches on the market are either big, gawdy, blingy, littered with non-functional dials or downright aesthetically unpleasant. The Susenstone Wood Grain watch is none of that. The wood grain watch face is simply but provides a pleasant contrast against the black lettering of the watch. The movement itself is silent and accurate. The crystal surface is clear and free of defects, as is the shiny-brown stainless steel watch body. Straps are made of wood-grained leather though they do come from the factory feeling rather stiff, hence why I have it wrapped around a watch case cushion to help it form a more natural shape. Note the while needles are NOT photoluminiscent and you will not be able to read this watch in the dark, although that hardly seems to matter since this is more of a fashion watch as opposed to a multi-functional watch. I am very pleased to add this watch to my collection at a discount for review!, Perfect fit at an excellent price. You can't go wrong with this band. It fit my GW -500A Casio perfectly., Invictas. Good watches for those who like larger faces., Just purchased this watch. I have the rangeman and frogman and many other casio watches. The mudmaster is the best yet., Great watch strap, only complaint was that there wasn't enough adjustment holes on the band itself my wrist is small, but I was able to make a new hole and now it fits perfectly, the best watch I've owned so far! long lasting battery and the LED time generator is so visible that you can still see it in night time!, Fantastic sport watch used it recently during a climb. I could read the time in the middle of hot sunny day with no problem-I have the black on black model. Easy to program with the instruction booklet. U small wrists and the band fits comfortably not to tight or loose with room to go either way. Would love this even more if it was resin and metal band like a white baby g model I bought a few years ago, but love this one and it's better than I had imagined and comes with a tin case., The watch is great but the belt are to short, I have big hands and it just wont make around my wrist, I need a extra long wrist belt., This was a gift sent to a family member.  I received an acknowledgment of receipt, but not an opinion of whether they liked, or disliked this item.  Sorry I cannot give you a true rating on this item., The watch broke after less then a week of use. Don't buy., The two tone wrist band takes everything away from this item. I had to return this item.., I have only owned for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to performance quality. Will update if there are any concerns. But, here's so far:<br /><br />Appearance: The design is ***very nice***. Classic lines and dials; the overall look is like a modern twist to a traditional styling - sort of like Kenneth Cole clothing. The buttons are on the left - I've never seen that before. It is very eye-catching, and it is very BIG, but in the gray color (which I have), it's not over-done.<br /><br />Quality: I can't speak for long term performance, but the piece looks and feels like it is excellent, especially for the price. The band is genuine leather, and feels it, while it matches the watch color. Very pleased.<br /><br />Function: mine has kept perfect time so far. The chronograph (stopwatch) actually uses the large second hand, while the actual second hand is the small dial on the left; this is not my preference, but I've had that in a watch before. The numbers are clear and easy to read at a glance. The water resistance is sufficient for anything I plan to do with it on. In other words, splash, etc, but I'd take it off for swimming, showering, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very attractive, easy to read watch., It is OK.  Light is only bright half of the watch., I ordered this watch about a month ago. I like the looks of it and the ability to change the back ground to numerous different colors, the bad thing is the buttons are a little to big, my wrist sweats from the rubber watch band and I don't know how it happened but I just noticed that have already cracked the crystal, right across the middle!, When I got it on my mail box I receive it on a different screen colour. It look nice but it's different than the one I bought, Bought this for my 10 year old son. I have been pleased with the watch., Like the weight and style.  Getting the links changed was a snap with the right repairman., Watch arrived quickly and in perfect condition, was just as advertised. Love the grey and blue color way. Had to return because it was just a little too big on my little wrist. Wish i could find it in a ladies smaller version., Nice looking watch but arrived damaged. Clasp was broken and the second hand was just floating around. Package may have been dropped or mishandled, but either way something you intend to wear daily shouldn't be so fragile. Doesn't seem to be of any real quality. There are many higher quality watches on Amazon around the same price point., I've used them a few times now and it pays to have the right tool for the job.<br />Holding up well., Excellent, Everything works fine now and looks great! It took about 8 hours under my desk lamp to fully charge it but keeps perfect time! Friends at work keep asking where I bought it? I send them to Amazon, Leather belt broke as shown in the paint , two weeks of use, Ok so the watch is really cute but it was smaller than i expected, was going to give to my bf but it seemed better suited for a woman. Not sayin a man couldnt wear it tho, just tryna give an idea about the size. I dont think the face is real wood, and that was a bit of a let down since that's what seemed to make the watch. But i still think its cute so 3 stars, Best watch EVER!, This Is a very beautiful watch., I have been researching Casio rangeman's for two years and this watch fulfills my criteria. The carbon fiber band is light and durable, the watch is somber and somewhat accurate for its functions. I was pleasantly surprised that with Premium Japan's quick delivery, and the packing with the watch. It is more expensive than the base model and my friend is just as satisfied with his base model. This watch suits a particular person criteria more than as general purchase or gift.<br /><br />Like<br />The negative display and other features listed<br /><br />Disliked<br />I can't seem to work out how to set the light to last more than 2 seconds for the display. It is missing some functions from the base model in terms of programming.<br /><br />Overall Happy with my purchase because it suits my needs., Love the watch. But had to return for replacement due to defect. Hour and minute hand are misaligned.  The minute hand must reach the 12 minute mark before the hour hand is on the hour marker. Sounds trivial, but it was so obvious.  Hope to get good replacement.  I will review again. Replacement received.  No hassles.  Works perfectly. 5 Stars., The watch is a gift for my grandson and I haven't opened the box.  I am sure it will be a great gift for him., Great fishing watch for inter-coastal fishing in St. Augustine, FL. I actually set it for Porpoise Point Beach because I fish the jetties across the bay where the tide is VERY VERY swift at incoming and outgoing tides. So, this helps greatly! It is also very rugged, I go fishing offshore almost every Tuesday and for several months was fishing a minimum of twice a week. Plus, I wear it every day because it looks OK and is accurate, I have not had to reset the time since I bought it.<br /><br />I also love the fact that I don't have to change batteries, because my last Casio fishing watch (Pathfinder PAS400B-5V) battery could not be replaced without sending it to the factory...and they couldn't even tell me how much it would cost to replace it until I sent it to the factory!!! Can you believe that rip-off?! AND it may have cost more than the watch! Plus the band broke and the replacement band, once again, would cost more than the watch! (Wow, I just discovered today that the watch I bought for $25.50 now sells for $248!! So, maybe I should get the battery replaced by the factory now and buy a new band! HA!)<br /><br />Anyway, back to this watch...I was concerned about being able to see the dial it in the sunlight and also concerned about it not staying charged indoors...but I was happy to discover that neither of those concerns were a problem. In fact, I press the night light several times a night with no problem at all!<br /><br />Also, I recommend downloading the Instruction guide from online because the one that comes with the watch is so small that I could barely read it. Plus you can search items of interest with the PDF, which makes it muuuuuuch easier to learn how to use it and set it up!!!<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it does not have the &#34;best fishing times&#34; by showing small fish on it like my last Casio fishing watch (PAS400B-5V).  In fact I searched for days to find a &#34;reasonably priced&#34; fishing watch withall three fishing aids...moon, tide and best fishing times and found none! If anyone finds one at a reasonable price please reply to this and I will buy it! (But, hmmmm I am not actually sure if I can read a reply.)<br /><br />FYI: I also purchased the Casio Men's Casual Sport Watch (W753-1AV) but did not like it because I could not read the tide chart well nor the moon phase especially in sunlight. In fact, I am not even sure the tide chart worked because it never showed the correct tide. Compared to this watch, the W753-1AV is very inferior in my opinion. But oddly, I see it has high ratings by others. (But, that may be because they have not owned both to compare.)<br /><br />Good fishing!, Love this watch! Light weight well illuminated.easy to use..<br />Band is ok but hard to unlatch as the band has a locking tab which seems a bit tough to remove<br />All in all a great watch for the money!, This watch replaced my older Casio, which I had for over ten years.  Nice fit.  I use it for easy of readability and date.  The dual-time is helpful.  I just wish it had a light, like my old one., My husband is very happy with it.  Easy to read., New Variety Watch, Original strap on my Alessi lasted about two years.  This replacement lasted less than six months.  It's cheap and tears easily, especially if moist., EXCELLENT QUALITY WAS THE EXACT REPLACEMENT, I got a few watches that I wear from time to time... Lol but I'm definitely hook on this one., get all kinds of compliments, I received this watch yesterday and automatically I wore it since I had two events to go to. My first impression of this watch,  very elegant and classy design. Love the beautiful color wristband. I was super excited to be wearing my new watch, until I actually went to put it on, too big for a small wrist, it only has 6 holes to adjust size, I needed to make 2 more so it could fit me. As the night went on, I needed to keep sliding down the strap to hold it in place, that unfortunately lead to the strap holder from detaching itself. Other than it being a pretty watch, I really feel the wristband quality is very cheap, but it's definitely one of those items that you get for what you pay type of thing. I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review., My husband loves the big, easy-to-read numbers on this watch. It is his go-to work watch because he can read the face without his glasses. He also has a Timex Ironman multi-lap/memory watch that he uses for running, but this is more ideal for day-to-day use. This is the second one that I have purchased for him in the past 10 years (normal wear-and-tear for him includes a broken band, scratched face and that general worn-out look, so we shopped for a new one and were delighted to find the same version still available). He loves it., All the best to say about this well made watch. Durable, works well and accurately. Very happy with this purchase., Okay, This is a nice watch, for the price. And, the blue face just adds to its appeal. However, the watch band is tight on my wrist, which measures 7 3/4 inches. To solve this problem, I called Armitron and made a complaint about this matter.<br /><br />Armitron's response was that they're going to send three links, for free, to expand the size of this watch band.<br /><br />It's a small inconvenience. But, it's worth it, in my opinion., I've had good experiences with Seiko watches over the years, so when my old (non-Seiko) died, I picked this model both because of its classic looks, its day/date display, and because my interest was piqued by the built-in solar-recharging for the battery, especially since this last feature added little or no cost compared to the direct non-solar competition.  Thus far, I like this watch a lot; it's solid, attractive, massive enough to feel like quality but not so heavy as to be a burden, and its size both suits my wrist and is neither too small to easily read the time nor so large that it catches on or bangs against things. My only complaint would be that my aging eyes would appreciate a larger day/date display, hence the deletion of one star; too often I must squint at it to make out what the day is (is that a 26 or a 28?) It's far too early (only 4 months so far) to judge how much savings there will be in batteries due to the solar charging feature, but if I get at least 5 years out of the original battery, I'll be happy (usually they last one to one and a half years each in non-rechargeable watches)., I have received a lot of compliments with my pocket watch. Would buy again!, very nice looking watch, stylish, thin, the strap is a bit long<br />I wear this watch mostly with business attire, Nice swatch with a crappy plastic strap! I will buy a new strap!, I'm glad I bought this Watch and I'm happy with the price : ), This is a decent tool that (eventually) allowed us to do the necessary repairs on our watches. The space that holds the watch bands is almost large enough to fit most of our watches, although a few of my husband's watches were too wide to fit in the space. It comes with extra replacement bars and pins which was very nice since a couple have already broken. The biggest disappointment was that the first time we used this tool, it broke. It literally just snapped in half. Thankfully we were able to super glue it back together and we haven't had any problems using it since. The glue seems to be holding it together just fine, but it's really not fun to have an item break the first time you use it. So overall, the quality isn't fantastic, but we made it work and have been able to adjust the bands of several watches with it., This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />This is a FANTASTIC watch! I purchased the white one, which seems to be no longer listed, but it came in a sleek black box<br />The leather feels real, with plenty of adjustable notches (it fits me well) and has another loop to thread the excess strap through which I appreciate a LOT (so that the excess strap doesn't get in your way or bent back and forth)<br />It's light, and clearly high quality - simple and stylish and minimalist<br />I've already received several compliments, and it matches everything!<br />You won't regret buying it!, This watch is for extremely small wrists! Unfortunately, I won't be able to wear it., As expected, This is a very solid, well made watch. It comes in a nice box and is very well packaged to protect the watch from damage. The face and band are completely covered in peel off plastic to protect it. The watch is turned off and cannot be turned on until you remove a plastic piece below the middle dial on the right side. After removing the plastic insert the watch immediately began running. The color is a dark charcoal (not quite black I think) -- it has just a hint of metallic in the color keep it from being jet-black. The other ring rotates for time zones.<br /><br />I found the watch to be a bit heavier than I expected from the look. The face piece is about the same as a modern large cellar linked watch like a Samsung, Motorola, or iWatch. The price is such that it is about in the same range as the Motorola 360.<br /><br />It's a nice watch, but I don't think it is as simple as I prefer and the metal band is not as comfortable as a well fitted leather band. That said the steel band will certainly last longer than any leather band. My preference is still the Moto 360 watch which weighs less and obviously has far more features., What a find! I needed to replace a water resistant watch that could not be repaired. Also needed good contrast on face to see w/o glasses. Nice looking, great for swimming , face is size of quarter., came broken in 3 pieces, Fine, Kinda a big face and uncomfortable on my wrist while lifting, Is not working now. Is not the battery cause  I changed it., Scratches easily:(, I have a couple Swiss Legend watches and really like the quality that they put into their products. This watch is a very attractive one with day, date and time zone adjustable and a stopwatch feature. I needed the manual to figure out all the setup, but it worked out just fine and it is running great. This is a very large and heavy watch. That is how I prefer them, but be warned!<br /><br />I prefer metal bands, and this one is a nice one, but I don't like the way it latches. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is not as easy to latch as other watches  I own. It also requires an extremely tiny screwdriver to take out links on the band (this one was a bit too large for my wrist), so that could require a stop to a local jewelry store to have the band adjusted. I tend to feel awkward asking a jewel to adjust a watch I bought online... Otherwise a great watch and one  I will wear regularly., Pretty much as advertised. Bought it to dress up a Timex Weekender and it looks good.  Not a huge fan of the long strap, but, that is the style of these bands., This was perfect for my 9yro, could not get pass shoulders, I was excited to receive this watch. After initial struggles to get Android Wear to recognize this watch, it worked well for two days. Then mysteriously it stopped showing notifications and stopped vibrating. No amount of factory reset and unpairing and re-pairing helped. Finally I returned it. I will wait for a better watch to come along., Excellent and works exactly as stated, Very dainty watch that looks pretty on my small wrist.  The gold is hardly noticeable as you can see mainly silver unless you look closely.  That's not an issue for me as the watch is very pretty and feminine.  It does not look cheap at all.  It feels very light as well and can easily be worn to dress up or down., I have a hard time seeing the screen, the numbers are too light. The buttons are confusing. This would be good for a young kids that just needs a watch. I wanted to use it for running, but since I can't see it well in the sun, no good. Plus I couldn't get the times working right. Miss my old Nike watch that broke., Excellent product as advertised!!, The watch on the photo so orange,real thing is ok., Great value for a very nice watch.Several people thought it was a Rolex. Only minor complaint is band is a little tight on my wrist. It came adjusted all the way out. Still a little tight., This is a fun, inexpensive, waterproof, watch that just works and does more than you expect. For the price, I have no qualms with the quality. Right on the face, you can see the date and day, time, seconds, and whether you have an alarm on. It has a timer mode, backlight button, and is pretty easy to set too. In fact it took me about as long to figure out how to get the instructions out of the watch stand as it did to learn how to work the watch (stupid plastic stand).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-shows  a lot of information in one glance--again day, date, time, pm, seconds, which alarms are on. Then there's a ton of quick stuff available: timer, 2nd timezone, stopwatch, alarm, hourly chime.<br />-easy to work, you press button B (lower left) to cycle through modes: SP (stopwatch), AL (alarm set), TR (countdown timer set), T2 (second timezone). You press the C button (upper right) to start/stop/advance. You hold the A button (upper left) to change things (TR, AL, T2, regular settings). May sound complicated, but after you play around with it for five minutes while staring at the little instructions and cursing for the first two minutes it really does makes sense!<br />-jelly styling is pretty retro cool--the twelve year old in you will love it, but you'll think it's pretty cool too...<br />-wears nice and is comfortable<br />-cheap--doesn't cost much for what feels like a quality device<br />-backlite works well and just lights the information which looks cool<br /><br />cons:<br />-cheap-I would prefer Japanese quartz movement to the Chinese quartz movement that this is, but it keeps time so far which is the point<br />-The watch face is convex and I think it's just plastic which makes me think it's going to get scratched up very easily. I would prefer a convex watch so it's harder to scratch the face<br />-the warranty is kinda a joke. It's a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for the shipping and include a check for $9.95. You might as well buy another watch at the cost of the warranty! But the watch is so cheap, and seems to be well made, that I'm not knocking it at this time. I really wish there was some length of the warranty that you did not need to send the check (if it has issues in the first 90 days you don't have to send the check--but it doesn't work this way). I guess if it breaks quickly, you call Amazon!<br />-battery is pretty easy to replace, but most jewelers will help you too<br /><br />We like it a lot. My wife likes it and is wearing it now. I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!cost of the warranty!

I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!, Broke the strap on my black one and went buy new pins and seen this watch. Had to have it!, Ok, I have had it some time now.  The crystal still has no scratches.  The watch is incredibly light and durable. I love the watch!, Exactly as promised, NEVER WORKED! Hassled trying to return it. WASTED MY MONEY!, Great watch and seems like a quality build.  However, the screen is not as bright as I had hoped for.  Maybe they didn't design it to be as bright as I would like, or maybe my eyes are not as young as they used to be, although I am only 41.  I wear it at the gym to time the time between sets.  Since the gym is quite brightly lit, the lighting function is of no used.  Bottom line: good quality watch, but the contrast of the numbers to background is too low to be usable for me.  It's like trying to read from one of the early versions of the Kindle.  Just my opinion though.  Hope that helps someone., Don't waste your money, Love this watch! Very easy to read the time,very comfortable and light weight. Got tons of compliments 1st day wearing it!, Very nice looking watch. I would rate it 5 stars except tht the crown extends below the case and catches easily on pants pocket when reaching for keys, change, etc. When withdrawing hand, the crown catches and pulls the stem out, effectively stopping the watch. This stem does seem to pull much more easily than other Fossil watches I own., Watch works fine. Bought it &#34;used: like new&#34;. However, it arrived damaged.  One of the crystal stones in the band had fallen out. Should be an easy fix at a jewelry repair place, but still is an extra hassle. Band should have 3 stones. Bottom link next to the face only had 2, dial is hard to read and band fell apart after two weeks of use, This Casio Solar-Powered Digital Watch has been around in one form or another since the 1980s and is still one of the best low-cost digital watches on the market ... assuming you aren't a cave dweller who never leaves your basement.<br /><br />As the name suggests, this is a 100% solar-powered digital watch; you never have to buy one of those stupid little watch batteries again. Electrical power comes from a small bank of solar panel cells that feed electrical current to a capacitor inside the watch. The capacitor essentially acts as a battery and as long as you allow the solar panel cells to absorb some light every day the capacitor will stay charged and keep your watch running perfectly.<br /><br />The biggest &#34;problem&#34; with this watch is the unfortunately long initial charge cycle for the capacitor (an unavoidable flaw in having a battery-free design). The capacitor is completely dead when you first remove the watch from the box, and since the digital components require a &#34;relatively&#34; large amount of voltage the capacitor can't keep up with the demand until it is FULLY charged. This means you have to leave the watch out in the sun (with minimal cloud cover or shade) for a full day and then still charge it under a BRIGHT lamp indoors after the sun goes down for a full night before the capacitor has the charge needed to get started.<br /><br />There is a little &#34;sun&#34; icon that appears below the time if the capacitor is running low. Even after the sun icon disappears during the first day of charging you STILL have to leave the watch out to charge (again a full day of sunlight and a full night of bright lamp light at least) for that first charge.<br /><br />After the capacitor has received a full initial charge you won't have to worry about charging it again as long as you spend at least 45-90 minutes outside every day and the solar panel isn't covered by your shirt sleeve. An hour to an hour and a half of sunlight is all this watch needs to keep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night. Granted, even a single low-voltage LED would drain the capacitor VERY quickly and defeat the purpose of having a battery-free watch, but it would have been nice to have a light. I suppose I'm willing to put up with the lack of a light if it means I never have to buy another watch battery and never have to remove the cover from the back of this watch.<br /><br />If a solar-powered and battery-free digital watch sounds like a good idea to you then you'll absolutely love this watch. Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs.eep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night.

Thank God for kids!, The battery life of this watch has been mentioned so frequently in past reviews for being mediocre or bad but I'm glad to say after a few software updates, the Moto 360 can easily last through a typical day with some to spare. It's not without drawbacks though, to survive the day you will need to use it without the ambient screen on, and that slight delay between raising your wrist up and the screen turning on can be frustrating to some.<br /><br />Having come from a Pebble, not having an always-on display needs some getting used to. While the accelerometer does it's job well in detecting your arm movement to turn on the screen; at times say when you are sitting at a desk and need a quick glance at the time, you'll need to wake the watch up by tapping the screen or pressing the side button - unintuitive.<br /><br />The vibration motor on the Moto 360 is also fairly weak compared to the Pebble, I have missed several notifications because I couldn't feel the vibration. Then again, your experience might vary.<br /><br />Despite being powered by an old TI Omap processor, the watch performs decently with the latest software update. The watch might feel a little sluggish during the first few seconds after turning on the screen but that is definitely not a deal-breaker in my opinion, during normal use it's snappy.<br /><br />Fitness tracking is normal, nothing fancy. However, as mentioned in many other reviews, the heart rate sensor requires you to stay still for it to take a reading, so if you are planning to do some running with HR tracking you will have to look elsewhere. Not having a GPS built-in means you'll need to be tethered to your phone when you go out and hit the road.<br /><br />Overall the Moto 360 is a fairly good buy at $149, considering the LG G Watch R costs twice as much. While it looks pretty, being one of the first Android Wear device means it come with it's own fair share of flaws as well. However, if you can live with these flaws that I've mentioned above (not many), and are looking to buy a smartwatch without breaking the bank, this is a safe bet. It is a beautiful smartwatch that will turn some heads on the street and few might come up to you and ask if that's an Apple Watch.<br /><br />p.s. The successor to the Moto 360 should be announced soon so you might want to think twice before hitting that add to cart button., I start saying sorry for my english. I buy two of this watch. It is sold by amazon UK at 18£. Amazon don't allow to buy this item from USA to Italy. Recently timex change the name of this watch from atlantis100 to one impersonaly end generical: expedition. that is the name of a line of timex product as iroman,ecc... I prefer atlantis100 because this watch is a sequel of a specific and charaterial model that born with this acquatic name. I love the things that have a story and continuity. A univocal name can give a strong identity,specialistic fashion and plus value to a product. Atlanti100 name strengthened the immagin of this watch in sea and acqua sport scope. Dear timex,was it necessary to change name? You prefer call your watches as expediton t1246322,expedition t63515627,ecc...who are? I know that is difficout and expensive to find a fashion name for mass and economical product models,perhaps your experienc reccomended that it have not sense,but if you have one of them that have just a name,please don't cut it. The custom remember and speak of a product if it have a name,identity and continuity.it is more simply to become best sellers. Anyway Timex brand is a consumer and economic watch producer and they build their watchs in a very good quality standard. The watchs is my passion and i like always looking  for them. in my collection i have a lot of watches, somethings of them stay in a very different expensive level like this but atlantis100 deserves attention because has very special and rare tech spec. it is not simply to find a watch so light and slim that have 100m watet resist limit. The dial of atlantis100 is very '80 fashion,has a sport specialistic and &#34;professional&#34; aspect. the color of display changing if you change the looking inclination.it can appear yellow,green,grey...very,very special. In a first look you can think that the watch is small but it is not true.the dimension is guessed for a watch with essential digital dial,basic functionand that don't want clutter. Who want a very &#34;manly&#34; watch look at other models. The rubber strap is ligth, confortable and frendly to fit. The atlantis100 has all foundamental for a watch:hours,minutes,seconds,day,date,month,alarm,illumination(very good),waterproof(good for acqua sport use)....and plus...timer,stop watch and second time zone. Battery has a very good five years life. The timex atlantis100,with his 30g,is a good partener for summer time,sea activity and sports. It knows get look,it knows get hear (beep),without get feel on wirst. it is a little that can follow you everywere. 18£ are a very nice price for a particolar  and reliable watch like this. You can &#34;fall in love&#34; of it., Amazing! Just what I wanted., The watch looks very nice, and the dial has a very clean display, would def recommend., I love my Vestal Brig! The tides are very accurate, and it's got a lot of settings inside that are helpful. I've gotten so many compliments on it!! Couldn't ask for a better watch., Outstanding watch design. Received many compliments.  Looks far more expensive than it was., Yes, The watch is bigger than I expected. However, I like large watches as I'm a tall guy I'm very impressed. The watch gives the classy look of analog and the modern conveniences of a digital watch., I am very happy with this watch. It has what I was looking for., Putting things in context, I have an Apple Watch, Microsoft Band, and 3 MIO Fitness Bands. I'm only mentioning this because, in the price range of the SMARTE, it is decent value within a somewhat narrow universe of buyers.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The One Feature That Makes It Worthwhile to One Subgroup<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Right off the bat, the biggest benefit is that streams notifications -- as long as you have an Android phone. My primary phone is currently a iPhone 6 Plus. But I was able to test this using my old LG G2 and, sure enough, notifications from apps that were able to limp along on Wifi only came through on this watch after I paired.<br /><br />Why is this such a big deal? Well, what gets me paying attention phone are notifications, i.e. text messages, emails and reminders. As has been the case with my Microsoft Band, which I use more than the Apple Watch, because the battery drain is less of a hassle, I can be more selective about the instances in which I'll take my phone out of my pocket because I can see it on my watch.<br /><br />So now, you can that at a low price point, as long as you're on an Android phone.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Rest of Story...Not as Quite as Impressive<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In most other instances, the SMARTE Watch in not in same league of high tier watches such the Apple, Microsofts, and LGs...or even mid-tier smart watches such as the Pebbles, Samsungs, and Jawbones. It has non-HD screen that will seem pretty retro compared with you low resolution compared along-side your phone. When I say retro, I don't mean Game Boy retro, which is viewed as hip in some circles. I mean retro as in Palm Pilot (although in color).<br /><br />Other impressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is. It's got a nice band with rubber texture. Adjustable too ...I think it fit most wrists. Since it goes into power save mode and your screen is off most of the time people can really tell what it is until you turn the screen on.<br />♦ It's got a touch screen, which allow you access all it's function, such as: time, date, calculator, and pedometer. However, I did not find the touch screen to be as responsive the smart phones have been for the past three years.<br /><br />To be fair, my review is in the context of Android phone uses because of the notifications. iPhone uses should probably not consider it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon does not have rating available, I'll give it four stars.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogicpressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is.

Light and good looking, Very nice.  The face is actually a bit more gray that I expected, instead of the black it appears to be online.  I had a different version of this same watch for about 10 years, so I opted to stick with it., [[VIDEOID:dae27737f337c776423c7999c6781874]]This BUREI watch is an attractive quartz movement watch. The watch is classy and elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 8.25\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8.5\\\\\".<br /><br />The watch's face is 1.5\\\\\" wide and the watch is 3/8\\\\\" thick.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so you need to match your dial to one in the photo to get the details on how to set various options.<br /><br />The first position of the crown allows to adjust days of the month.<br />The second position of the crown allows to change time.<br />To select the day of the week I need to rotate the time until the right day appears in the display window.  This is a bit time consuming as to go to the next day you need to rotate through 24 hours.  If you miss it you cannot go backwards to you can only go forward.<br /><br />The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing, but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, Perfect, I have this watch, and it is my everyday watch. It's fantastic. Very attractive.<br /><br />Incredibly sturdy-the sapphire crystal is much thicker than in most watches, making it very strong. Part of where it get's is waterproof rating from.<br /><br />One of the best but least appreciated features of this watch is that it almost never needs to be opened. Opening the watch can destroy the water seal, and even a new O-ring may not fully restore it. But since there is no maintenance needed on this watch, and no batteries to replace, it just does not need to be opened. Heck,if it weren't for Daylight Savings Time, you would not even need to loosen the crown!<br /><br />I do put it outside one day a year, in full sun, to make sure it is really charged up. And as others have pointed out, in the dark, the second hand stops, to save energy. In fact, the manual says that if it is in the dark for long enough, and the battery gets low, the hour and minute hands will stop also, but the watch will continue to keep time.<br /><br />I do wish it was a touch larger, but other than that, I know of no other watch I would rather wear. I have an Omega, and a couple of other watches, but this is on my wrist 99% of the time., Looks and feels like PVC. Cheap and nasty., contacted seller about watch ,hour and minutes hands not moving, the second hand advanced around,but the minutes hand of the watch does not move therefore the hour hands does not move which leads to the watch not keeping time....., Outstanding. Get compliments on it for such a cheap watch.  My expensive watches broke or died and this works well. Had one in black but the wrist strap slid broke. I use it in my desk as  desk clock. Love the blue. Wish it was Ravens purple., I love the watch, but disappointed it didn't come with instructions on how to change the date., if it says g-shock, you can't go wrong! this watch is great, nothing bad about it! i have the red trim & orange trim models of this watch. g-shock is all i buy now =), I installed this watch band two weeks ago on the watch I wear every day.  Yesterday I noticed that the band segment with the notches is fraying and appears to be falling apart.  I have purchased replacement bands previously through Amazon for this watch and have not had similar experiences but this one is a defective product., Don't waste your money. The thing fell apart on me while I was on a date. I mean literally fell off of my wrist onto the floor. Can you say embarrassing......and while ur at it CHEAP!!!!!, elegant or classy to look at for the price that is unbelievable...will recommend!, I like the fact of a casual watch that is easy to read.  As plus size, It looks good on my wrist - not to small.  On hot, hot days, the band does not irritate my skin.  Well worth the money!, Decent quality watchband, but definitely very long!  Measure your wrist!, takes a genious to program,which i am not.great looking watch ., It is a very elegant and beautiful watch., I received this product as pictured and advertised.  It was safely packaged and undamaged.  The craftsmanship is nothing but, EXCELLENT.  Wolf have been building these watch boxes since 1834, and their experience with the trade shows on their products.<br /><br />This particular box utilizes a nice thick viewing glass.  The hinges and lock are built solid.  The lock is slightly tight and firm to turn, but gives a good sense of security.  The stitching of the leather around the box is precise.  The black pebble faux leather and the silver textured silk lining looks, feels, and smell so elegant.  There are ample amount of room for my 47mm and 49mm Dive watches as well as ample space between the viewing glass and top of my 13mm Dive watches.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this box knowing it is built to last and it will display my watch collection with style., Tide and compass hard to figure out., Wonderfull, grest piece looks expensive for price., The watch is classy looking and not very heavy. The teal color is not as pronounced as in the picture. It is more to the navy blue side all the same a  good looking watch.<br />The packing  was appalling.  Watch was out of the box and moving  around freely in a very very large  box because they included  it with another item . There was no packing material  at all. I have to wait and see if the watch continues to work. Four star because  of  the poor packing., The watch was a prime day purchase to get started on Christmas shopping, it arrived and I was so very disappointed, it looks so cheap. Really looks like it came from the dollar store., Beautiful looking watch....., Night Back light stopped working after 2 months.<br /><br />I didn't pursue warranty due to low cost.<br /><br />I'm tired of buying this SH!t!!!!!!!!!, Item just as described!!!, I received a balloon instead of the clock Bad never I buy more, It is a not expensive watch for that the quality is more and less, I love the look and feel of this watch....but I've had two and both times the strap pins snapped. My biggest beef Freestyle is you can't just order more straps. You literally have to contact their CS depo, pay $17.00 for the straps, and then another $5 for shipping., I recently purchased this watch as my everyday time piece. Shipping and delivery was fast. The watch is beautiful. I love the gunmetal color. Although it's nothing elaborate, I get plenty of compliments over my watch. I've only had it a few days to a week so i havent had any issues. The only issue I have is that it's a snug fit on my wrist., Works for me and simple to use. Only downside is that I cannot screw in any pieces on the top half - it falls right off. But it's still usable nonetheless. Changing my own watch batteries saves me more money than getting price gouged by local mall jewelers for a task so simple and cheap., Pros<br />• Decent size and weight (actually feels like a solid watch)<br />• Face and chronographs are easy to read (numbers)<br />• Sleek colorway with nice polished chrome accents (noticeable on the wrist)<br />• The buttons on the side of the bezel are non-intrusive (could be worn on either wrist)<br />• Fairly easy to understand, straight forward instructions (nice manual included)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for sizing (could fit varying wrist sizes)<br />• Invicta always have good packaging (sturdy box with soft felt liner)<br /><br />Cons<br />• The color of the band and bezel seem like a cheap coating (chip easily if banged up)<br />• The watch clasp seems cheap, compared the rest of the watch (MSRP $1000)<br />• Curious why there is a date window and date chronograph (seems repetitive)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for smaller wrists, leaves you with one link on each side (could offer more removable links or wider links)<br />• TritNite Night Glow doesn't last that long (even with prolonged sunlight exposure)<br />• Comprehensive manual isn't model specific (general instructions for wide range of models), this its a piece of s*** dont buy the clasp broke the same day i got it!!!!!!!!!!!! i repeat your wasting your time!!!!!!!!, I love it it's very classy. I get a lot of compliments., Like it a lot!, It is a very large watch with very large buttons., The band was  loose  upon arrival. Shipped back to company., Excellent,can't say it enough, excellent, price,, It's big.  It's heavy.  It's awesome! The battery works great.  The band was very large and needed to be re-sized, which is very simple using a jeweler's punch.  Love it!, beautiful watch. perfectly classy to wear with anything., I had one of these 15 years ago and it seems like it isn't made now with the same quality as it once was.  I had this watch for 3 days before it broke.  I loved my old camper, but these aren't made the same, I got this watch yesterday and immediately put it on. Have not taken it off since then. It's comfortable, small and practical. It was pretty easy to set up and for $11 I have more I could wish for, even an alarm and light. As a busy mom of two I think this will do the job perfectly. Oh yeah... AND it is waterproof, very important lol!, Cute clock for decoration purposes only. I got my boys each an alarm clock for their separate rooms and they sleep right through the alarm. Then the alarm turns off after a few seconds. I am returning them and getting clocks with louder alarms., Bought this for my son for christmas.  he loved the Batman logo and that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  He also likes that he can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way he could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when he is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., Got about 1 month out of it before it died, I bring these Invicta watches overseas when I travel to give as a quality gift, and everyone loves them,, This boy's watch is perfect for that age where kids really want grown-up things, but destroy them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />It has that Otterbox type of nubby, chunky look. Kids that like to figure out settings will really get a kick out of this.<br />Friends have a child on the autism spectrum that loves fussing with multi-function watches, and the grandparents gave him an expensive verion of this watch.<br />He was thrilled, and it engaged him for hours on end.<br />Then, naturally, it broke and of course lost all appeal.<br />This is the perfect watch for kids like my friend's.<br /><br />And remember, tomboy girls love watches like this!<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

Nonprofits are encouraged to inquire., When working on delicate machines such as watches, it's important to have proper, good quality tools.  This Case Wrench is well made.  High enough quality to keep the repair from damaging the case., While searching for a watch display case, I was looking for three main criteria:<br />1 - get my watches off of my bookshelf and into a nice looking case. Check<br />2 - give myself room for a few additional watches (had 5 at the time of purchase). Check<br />3 - don't spend too much money. Check<br /><br />I was not expecting spectacular quality given the price, but I have to say that I am impressed. The glass was scratch free and clean, the case itself was pristine, and the appearance is as advertised. I like to wear larger watches and this case fits them with no problems., I love this watch!! I have 3 of them in different colors! They are good quality watch faces,  however you might want to get a different band that is a better quality than the one that is on the watch. I get a lot of attention and compliments whenever I where it!, Excellent watch. Had to trial and error to find how to use all features. Couldn't find any kind of instruction anywhere., Excelente!!!, Teenage son purchased for his &#34;swag&#34;. It's very heavy, but he loves it. Fast shipping!, This is a very nice strap. Love the contrasting materials. Super well made, and fits perfect. This is a rugged, sporty looking modern band.. Awesome. I've worn it daily for a couple of months now, on my vintage Wittnauer 2000, and it's holding up perfectly. Surely going to last a long time., this product came broken and when i went to get it fixed nobody could help me, I remember first having this watch when I was around 7. Now that I'm 34 I went onto Amazon and got this same style watch. There is something special about the simplicity of this watch. Now-a-days everything is about the next big thing (Apple watch, android watch, etc. etc), which don't get me wrong, is fine.... But having the reliability of this F-91W on your wrist will go far and beyond what any new wearable can get you. For the price you can't beat it. You'll have a watch that will be maintenance free for more than 5-6 years. Exactly how it should be., This is a very nice watch. I wear watch's instead of bracelets so I have many. The finish on this watch looks really nice sort of like a brushed gold. One thing I like is the little heavier weight of the chain. I did receive this watch at a discount for giving a review but  I really like it., As presented, quick delivery., As a 14 year old who loves to show off, I came across this watch and with about $100 to spend ( 1 day shipping and tax included into that) I decided to purchase this watch. When The Shipment came in the next day, It looked flawless.  The box was perfect and the watch came with everything and even a little more like clothes and a manual.  When I first tried it on,  It wasnt even a close fit.  Unless you are a 280lb 6''4' lumberjack, there is no way this watch is going to fit you without taking out a few links.  I am 5''10' and about 150lbs and it fits perfectly with 1-2 links taken out from each side.  I managed to be able to do this at my house withing like 10 minutes but without the proper experience and equiptment, you probably should take it to a professional to adjust.  After getting the fit, the watch itself looks beautiful.  The 23k gold trim and the blue looks amazing.  Almost exactly like the rolex submariner collection,  but I didnt even buy this to be a copy which is the good thing.  Now every watch has its pros and cons so let me go over those.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Probably the nicest looking watch for under $100 basicly a steal<br /><br />Water resistant up to 200 meters (about 600 feet)<br />you should have no problem taking it to the pool, beach ect.<br /><br />Clasp is nice and gold plating is done nicely<br /><br />Winding and timer feature (manually)<br /><br />Very interesting back of the watch that is transparent<br />so you could see inside<br /><br />This seems a little gimmicky but the glow in the dark feature on this<br />watch is probably the best on any watch.  I am so used to it now.  Just<br />be sure to get it some sunlight or else it wont glow<br /><br />Now with all the pros there are obviously cons.<br /><br />Watch is only gold plated (which is expected for the price) meaning it scratches<br />very easily.<br /><br />Not a self winding watch so it loses I would say about 20-30 seconds a day<br />not a big deal for me but it might be for some people.  I just usually wind it every 2<br />weeks.<br /><br />Very flashy (which is for me a pro) but you might not like that.  I have people approach me from several feet<br />away asking about this watch so if you want to be like a fly on the wall, don't get this.<br /><br />Winding is a little tough but easy after getting used to.<br /><br />For me this watch is a definite buy for someone who wants to make a statement and is looking for an attention seeking watch beacuse trust me, 10s of people will approach you all the time (especially at my age)  It is the nicest watch in this pricepoint but if you are looking for a watch just to tell the time perfectly by the second, then this would not be recomended.  Overall a beautiful watch but it just depends what you like for in a watch<br /><br />Flashy, Pretty, Cool Features= buy<br /><br />Something to tell precise time, not very flashy/not trying to show off= don't buy<br /><br />Overall<br />I would recomemend this watch to about 85% of the people i knowht be for some people.

I just am skeptical because the Timex box it came in was tampered with.  Part of the box was cut out and I wonder why.  I have resubmitted my review because there is now a problem with the watch band.  A pin came out of the band and now the band it detached.  The pin must have come out while wearing the watch and now it cannot be worn without some repair work.  I did not get 3 months use from this watch., Definitely a cheapo version, but it will work., Got the mudman as a replacement for my lost rangeman, this review will contrast the two. I thought the lack of an additional sensor and bells and whistles from the rangeman would impact the watches performance. However, I can say that I prefer this watch because for me the watch face is more readible (less cluttered) and the watch is easier to operate. There are no accidental mode changes from the mode button mashing into my wrist, a common fault I found with the rangeman. As always, the mudman is a fantastic g-shock watch with all the quality you'd expect. Compass and moon phase function without error. For the price I dont think I would pick another watch. Would purchase again., Cheap... It's turning yellow, The watch arrived on time. Looks exactly the same as given in the picture. Ordered this as an anniversary gift for my wife and she absolutely loved the rose gold color and look of the watch on her hand. When compared with similar watches, found this one to be a little costlier. Overall happy with the product., This band's pin to hold it in place of the watch face is too sm to fit the Timex Indiglo watch that I own. It is the wrong size and I need to replace the pin., I like the subtle grey on black military look instead of the loud color models, but that's me. Not intuitive configuration and needed 20 minutes with the manual to set it and understand it. Haven't used a watch in 12+ years but it's a pain to dig out a phone to see the time when a flick of the wrist in a third of a second can tell me. Mineral glass should keep it lasting for years. Auto calendar good until 2099. +/- 30 seconds a month accuracy. Alarm tone is loud enough without being blaring although I doubt it would wake most people. Manual says 10 months of battery assuming 18 hours of display and 6 hours of sleep (it goes to sleep in dark conditions to conserve, light and hitting a button wakes it). ONLY the small digital display lights up so don't think you can use this to walk down a dark hallway. The analog hands are moved by magnetic force so that part of the timekeeping will be affected if you have the watch near magnets and you'll need to re-adjust. It isn't a G-Shock so big impacts or wearing it while using a chainsaw could cause it to malfunction. All in all a great watch to survive daily life if you don't need extra features., Add my name to the list of purchasers who know 1/1/2005 is a Saturday. And that I'm on Easter/NYC time although I live near Chicago., Low quality for the price, i was expecting more from guess, but arrived on time., Very nice watch could be set a little better but overall a plus, Husband wears this everyday to work. Loves it., Ordered this with the intention of using it on rough work days, and saving my other watches for special occasions. Man was I wrong. This is a beautiful and sporty watch. Shows well, feels excellent, and craftsmanship looks to be solid. Buy this watch. Looks very expensive, however, for the price, your receiving a GEM!!!!!......5 stars., I bought this watch many years ago and I'm still wearing it every day. I love this watch and I get compliments on it often. The solar cell means it never stops provided you wear it every couple of days. Just bought a replacement strap and it feels like a new watch. Simple, elegent, solid, reliable. 10/10 would watch again., The date can be a bit hard to see on my poor old eyes but it keeps perfect time, the band is easy to adjust, and it looks great. Once again delivery from Amazon was prompt and well within its estimate., this watch came yesterday, no box just in a baggy. that being said the clasp was a nightmare to figure out but once I got it, I realized how versatile it is and it's a great buy for the price., Love this watch.  Bought one of these back in '79.  Still working today.  Have over 3000 dives with it.  Started losing a little time lately so decided to buy another., Awsome watch I live big pretty watches so this fits my style, Very nice for business or evening. Good quality. Band runs large, buen producto!!, This is a pretty big watch but it's still cool. My (thin) 10 year old grandson has to put it on the last notch of the band but at least it fits. We've only had it a few days so hope it lasts., First, this is a very light and wearable watch. About the thinnest I could find in a day/date automatic with 200m ISO dive rated watch.<br /><br />Loved the watch until the second time I actually went diving with it (about the 5th time wearing it for less than a day). The diving wasn't the problem, it was after that I unscrewed the crown to adjust seconds (yes, it's a hacking movement, I also like that) and it would not, could not screw back down, no matter what I tried. Had the dive master at the shop try, another customer who had the same problem with a Tag tried. Nada. So it was no longer divable. Worse, I can't even use the watch since without screwing the crown down, there is no seal at all, even humidity would get in there. So for the price I paid and having used it for two dives and maybe five-days of wearing, this has become a monumental fail.<br /><br />Add to the fail: Mido parts (crown, stem, tube needed, according to repairer) are two-months out to get. Nice. I'm heading overseas in a matter of weeks and will be doing underwater research again, so many dive trips. NOT happy. Hopefully with this caveat I'll save others from the same fate (but hope others don't have the same experience!)<br /><br />-------------<br />Edit: Finally got it back &#34;repaired,&#34; saw the watch at the Mido dealer, inside the back it says, &#34;Hong Kong.&#34; They had to explain the case is made in China. Well..., one more dive in Thailand and, you guessed it. Something went amiss inside. Took it to a Mido repair center all the way up in Chiang Mai. They had for a week, all was well. For a few weeks. Just before flying out of Thailand I had the audacity to actually use the watch. BIG mistake. Unscrewing the crown (which had to have a new crown and tube put in, AFTER the Mido dealer in the US put a new crown and tube in - I think they knackered it, actually), the crown just came out, with the stem. Out of the watch. Completely. Great. This is the biggest POS of a &#34;Swiss watch&#34; I've ever own. Timex would be more reliable and for what I paid for this watch and all the repairs for wearing overall less than two-weeks, I could have bought enough Timex's to last me and my entire family ten-generations of time keeping. Anytime I see someone looking at a Mido, I relate this experience. Mido..., rhymes with, Yugo. Remember them, the cars that fell apart while you drove them? Same thing here..., exactly what I wanted, The watch is very comfortable to wear some bands pinch not this one. If you like stretch bands I would purchase this one. Amazon's delivery is wonderful less waiting for purchases., Love this watch!  Easy to set, really comfortable to wear and easy to read., I was very excited when this came in!! I love the size and the fit. The wristband is a little long, but other than that it's great. Super comfy. Love the face size - not too big, not too small. Perfect for work or going out, My husband happily contributes to this addiction and keeps choosing cool watches to add to the collection. I like all kinds, but in the category of giant-faced watches with fun, colorful bands, this is a new favorite of mine. I love ocean-y colors and simple designs. I also love the &#34;Indiglo&#34; feature from Timex. Which is, admittedly, kind of cheesy, but then so am I. Highly recommend this watch., What a cool unique looking watch! Designed in NYC and only a small number were made. This is one of my favorite digital watches and EVERY SINGLE PERSON that sees it asks where I got it from! It's definitely a conversation stater!, The watch itself is nice! The only thing I didn't like were the light that's supposed to illuminate the digital part. I think this was a BAD design by Casio. If they fix the light and actually illuminates from the inside and not from the bottom. This would be one of the best selling watch! I would give the watch design 5 stars. Casio-Please fix the light!, Very cheap, one didn't even work when I received them., Excellent watch, fast service. very happy, Love this watch sooo retro. I was scared of the fit cuz i have small wrists but took it all the way to the last whole and it fits with a swiftness so happy! GO CASIO, Sturdy little no nonsense watch with legible face and nice light-up feature so one can see what time it is in a boring movie.  I have had several of these.  They last about 3 years until the battery runs out, The protection that these screen savers provide is awesome and it was pretty simple to apply (once I actually read the directions lol). I definitely recommend it to anyone with a Neo 2., Very satisfied., Like the watch face easy to read.  Bracelet a little large for average size wrist.  Concerned a out durability of clasp, easy off and on but delicate clasp. Appearance is great, attractive design.  Overall,  good value for cost., Extremely disappointed to receive my watch DOA something wrong with the automatic movement, no matter what I've tried it will not tick. I've purchased an orient ray last year that still works but no luck this time. it's going back to Amazon I guess it's true you get what you pay for., This is a very nice time piece, I actually own a few Armitron Women's watches because there beautiful and well made, can be worn casual, or dressed up a bit and is generally priced very fairly. There is a different style of watch for varying taste. This particular watch is quite nice looking two tone, adjustable links,and water resistant keep good time as has my others. Its a quality watch for a good price and has a versatile look. I like it., Perfect large manly sized watch face (accept no smaller than 50mm!) and manly sized strap. Not as big and crazy like those &#34;gladiator watches&#34; on steroids and not small with a small strap that makes it look like a girls watch. This is what you are looking for. The watch itself is perfectly fine, typical alarm and nightlight features. Nothing special other than large digits if that is also what you are looking for. Great work or sport watch!, :), i like it, I just this watch two days ago. I got it for use when kicking and paragliding.<br /><br />I like it a lot. It's touch and functional.<br /><br />But there are some short comings:<br /><br />1) It's hard to read at low light. The light stays on for three seconds. That's okay for reading the time, but 3 seconds to read the compass, barometer and altimeter... not long enough. Along with the 3 second issue, I really wish that Casio and Timex got together for some sexy time and made one of these with &#34;Indiglow&#34; light tech.<br /><br />2) If you're an adult, it will remove all hair from your wrist... all of it. It's as if the engineers that design the watch spend most of the time and budget figuring out how to turn the band into the most efficient hair removal device ever invented. On a positive note, after only two days of wearing the watch, my wrist is as smooth as a baby's bottom... so smooth!<br /><br />3) The thermometer is supposed to tell you the temperature in the air around you. It does not. It tells you the temperature of your wrist. Removing the watch so as to get a proper temp reading, results in the removal of more hairs off your wrist. Choose your battles carefully.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I still like the watch and would recommend it to friends., Very cool watch that works incredibly well., I gave it as a gift and just got a call that the battery doesn't work, so I'll be sending it back. Although she liked the watch I'm hesitant to order it again., The best looking and elegant watch...works perfect and its very precise...i recommend this watch...looks more expensive..!, I like this style...I love my watch, I have one in blue too.  Fit ok, even when are<br />big, Thin like a piece of a paper. The leather smells like it's been dipped into a tub with chemicals., Very attractive; reasonably priced; functional, bad, band broke shortly after my son started wearing it., The price is right. It was a smaller face than expected but works fine., This is a fantastic watch for the money! The blue and gold contrast has to be seen in person to be appreciated and the movement window on the back is a neat feature to see all of the gears moving., You get what you pay for. For 20 bucks, i can live with it., If you want the best / highest quality NATO strap - DaLuca is worth the money, excelente, Pretty watch but broke within a month after purchase., I bought this for my daughter Dec. 2014 for christmas. The watch is beautiful she loves it but I have had to put batteries in it twice and this is just August. Cannot find a way to exchange it and it is suppose to have life time warranty. Can anyone help?, A VERY solid and well made watch band, we replaced the rubber one that had become old and brittle and WOW the watch looks amazing with the new one., Perfect for day hikes and everyday use!, Smaller than I was expecting (my mistake, not theirs), but I'm very happy with the purchase.  Numbers are easy to read, which is what I wanted.  Very nice watch., I bring these  watches overseas when I travel to give as a quality gift, and everyone loves them, they look more expensive then they are !!, Bought as a gift for my boyfriend he loves it! The only thing is the battery doesn't last for 2 days like I was under the impression before buying it, but its OK it still lasts all day before needing to be changed!, Came quickly. Huuuuge. Bigger and higher than visualized.  Too big for my wrist. Wife and don laughed at me.  I was impressed with the quality and the features, though.  I like it, but cant wear it in short sleeves. Good construction. Bought another watch at the same time for less, on amazon and get compliments on the blue polo watch., exactly what I wanted, The watch is awesome, but it came with a dead battery, just what I wanted, Very cheap and low quality item. Only lasted a month before having issues. Clock just stops so you can't rely on it to wake you up. Taking the battery out, wiggling it around, shaking it will make it start up again. But there is no way of telling how long it will run!, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />While I do like the look of this piece overall, I do have a couple complaints. The area where the leather pieces gather at the ends, attaching to the braided part, are white. I would've liked it better if there was a cap or the ends were colored the same so it's not as distracting. Also, the watch part doesn't doesn't stay in the center, it slides down towards the bottom. However, this watch/bracelet is soft and doesn't pinch or have any rough spots. It's not stiff where it's uncomfortable to wear and the charms are firmly attached. The watch is also very quiet, making the ticking sound not annoying at all., Very nice quality and feel.  It's held up for quite awhile.  There's definitely a thickness that you won't find in all watch bands, but I like it very much., This is such a beautiful & well made watch! I got it for myself as I no longer enjoy wearing a watch but am required to by my job to have one. It has a large clean cover that you can get engraved as well. Nice heavy chain as well!, This watch is a nice watch if you want one to beat up. It ticks fine and has the nice Indiglo back light. The proble that this watch has is that it is very easily scratches. I have a gouge on the face of mine that looks like someone dragged a drill across the face. Not sure how it got that way, but I only ever wear it to work (at a bakery). That being said, I have had two of these. The first one I had, the crown fell off. Again, no clue how, just looked at it and it was gone. I was given a replacement by Amazon, but that did not change the quality of the watch. If you're looking for something that looks good and is not over priced, this is a good watch, just don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Update: This is the last timex watch I will ever buy for more than $30. I used this watch for work and it could not hold up to my working conditions. I work at a gun range and also a bakery. Within one week of working the crystal sported a great gouge in and made it annoying to look at. This watch was also marred by smaller scratches from everyday use which made it look like someone had taken sandpaper to it. I quit wearing it regularly and made it a strictly work only watch. However after two weeks the watch met its end. The &#34;crystal&#34; had shattered and the watch was unreadable, ceasing to function. I didnt notice until I got home at the end of the night that it was in this condition. I didnt remember hitting my wrist hard on anything as I usually do if I smack my watch up against something, fearing that I may have damaged or broken it. But in this case I didnt notice or the actual hit which was the death blow must not have been that hard. The bottom line though is that this watch could not stand up to a couple weeks of normal wear and tear at work. I might pay $20 for this watch again, but certainly not the current (4/18/17) asking price of over $100. This watch has been broken for close to a year now, Im just now reminded of how much of a disappointment it was., I like it, Sizes are right, winds right, all good.  Just make sure you have enough clearance for the adjacent keys to rotate., All what I expected, The Watch is too big... how can I take some of the links off? The watch seems like it will strip, not good. Not happy about my order, Poor quality, I returned it., Nice watch for a boy or lady. Sporty design, and easy to use. Velcro band is better against the ski. When wet and dries quickly., Band broke in Four months time. Paint chipped off inside of band. Very cheap!, This watch is gorgeous! My wife loved the everything, the case it comes in amazing, and the bands are all great. It's on the smaller side which is nice. Pictures do not do this watch justice at all., I bring these Invicta watches overseas when I travel to give as a quality gift, and everyone loves them,, THESE ARE PROBABLY THE BEST EVERYDAY WATCH, This is such a beautiful, classy watch. It looks so much more expensive. I'm very happy with the watch., Stuhrling watch really looking great, beautiful fabrication, reasonable quality with attractive price $59 !!<br />i'm happy to wear this watch while typing my review on it,<br />good finish bracelet, awesome blue degree but numbers on outer ring not so perfectly printed ,<br />hope to sustain by time,<br />i did not test water resist feature; is it anybody have something to say abt that....?, Thisi is my second orders for the same watches... My daughter saw that I was wearing A black  one  and she felt in love with it!<br />She ask me to order more for her .. A difference of the other reviews on this item.. I'd dint have any problems missing stones or not working watches... So happy with my purchase., They look decent in her wrist being petite and 5ft tall. Large face and bright. She wears it often and likes it., A quality watch, great presentation, superior band and, so far, very accurate.  My only negative comment is that the backlight should be for the whole watch face not just the digital readout.  At night the readout is too small especially for wearers that have reduced close-up vision., 👌👌, With kind of had a kind of it's own. Randomly alarmed even though none was set. Watch was hard to set also., Micheal kors always have great quality...I'm hard on my jewelry but Micheal Kors always stays nice..love the watch will buy it again in yellow gold.., I bought these bands for an Invicta automatic watch.<br />I agree with the reviewer that wrote that these bands look better in person.<br />They are wider and thicker than I anticipated. Very secure and comfortable!<br />What I didn't notice right away is that there are little levers on the bottom side of the bands for installing or detaching these bands.<br />They also look very stylish!<br />These are the nicest bands I have found so far and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again in the future., This is a worthy investment for my new Samsung Gear 2 Neo.  After receiving my new watch as a birthday gift from my boys, I was too afraid to wear it to work.  Being in retail, I can't avoid scratching and banging the surface of my watches while stocking merchandise.  After applying one of the IQ Shield LiQuidSkins, I can see how many scratches I've already saved my watch from getting.  I've read a few negative reviews regarding a cloudy screen, but mine is crystal clear.  After the first day of use, I had a small bubble on the top of the screen that eventually went away in a day or so.  I reduced a star from my review because there is a small blemish on the top left corner of the shield.  This blemish may have been caused by mishandling, but it was there on day 1 of use so I'm not completely sure how it happened.  Regardless, I still have more shields to replace them as they are worn out, and I will definately buy more in the future to protect my beloved present., I got this one but with red digits.I like it so much I bought the one with blue digits. I have not got it yet but my friend like mine so much he bought one with the blue digits and he loves it.and I think its a great watch and if you like led watches like I like led watches you will loves your too&#62; I highly recomend this watch, little but powerful, Watch did not work!, I'm on my third now after the first two failed. The crown on the first fell off, and water got inside the 2nd which eventually caused it to stop working. The description is confusing because it says water resistant to 99ft which is a conflicting statement. Resistance means it can survive incidental water, but a depth rating implies waterproofness, which it clearly doesn't have. I still haven't found a design I like better, so I'll keep going with them, but wish it were truly waterproof., Disappointed. It won't  keep time  or proper date.  I'm usually completely satisfied from everything out of from Amazon this is the first and only thing I am not. Thank you Amazon. Many blessings, Caroline Romanski, Now I am wishing I had gone with another choice.  This is a big watch, almost two inches across.  It is also heavier than I am used to.  The band is quite large.  I had to take a couple of links out of it.  Whoever said this was easy much have had a different model than the one I received.  I had taken links out of a Casio watch a few years ago, and that one was much easier to remove links than this one.<br /><br />Perhaps I will get used to it.  One thing I appreciate is that this one really looks water resistent.  That may come in handy., Beautiful!!! Good watch for the price. Look exactly as shown in the pics. The only thing is, that &#34;you need to wear it at least 10 hours a day&#34; to keep it running..., Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I own a few battery operated watches and for a couple it pops the back right open. Others would be an ordeal. I guess I need to learn how to get it in the right position. Changing my own watch batteries sure beats going to a mall jeweler and getting price gouged for a task so simple and cheap.<br /><br />Update: I tried to open one of my watch backs (again) with this tool. After trying a dozen times and having the scratches to prove it, tt's just far too fat to fit much of the blade under. I bought another tool and I hope this will do the trick., Huge watch...purchase if your wrist is big., Item arrived on time and was nicely packaged. It actually looks better than the photos and works very well., very beautiful watch, Perfect! &#60;3, I was able to successfully attach it to my Pebble (1st Gen) after removing all 4 links that you can remove. However, this smaller size is still to large for my wrist which I do not like. It is able to move around from the edge of my hand to about 2/5ths of the way down my arm (about 4&#34;). So if you have small writs, I would recommend getting something else., Like everyone else has mentioned, these just aren't quality screwdrivers.  If what you're really using them for is for repairing watches, save up and get Bergeons.  That's not meant to be an elitist statement; these just really don't work.  The bits had already fallen out or fell out soon after they arrived for most of these.  One was missing both set screws, and the others only had one installed, which also meant that the blades don't stay coaxial to the handle.  It's very easy to scratch a watch when one of these decides to drop its blade, and no amount of tightening seems to fix them., Exactly what I needed at an amazing price!, Fantastic Time Piece, Able to use to replace battery in my Casio MTD1073  watch battery. However the chucks, they tend to slip., I'm really happy with this watchband.  I've been wearing a Luminox, supposedly Navy Seal, watch for 20 years and have gone through four or five rubber watchbands. Now, to have something different that's lighter, fits better, and will probably last longer is very satisfying., Gaffer one week of owning this beautiful watch it doesn't keep time properly !<br />Dud, Keeps Time. The buttons on either side don't work.  It's worth the $15., This is a good looking watch in silver with blue hands. It comes in a nice, sleeved gift box which includes a manual.<br />The watch is kinetically powered, and it started running as soon as it was placed on my wrist. It took a little while to figure<br />how to use all the buttons, (and to figure out what they were all for) and to set the time and date, but it wasn't difficult.<br />The closure clasp works easily, and doesn't pinch my skin like the last watch I owned.<br />I found the workmanship of this watch to be high, finishes are nice, and pieces fit together really well. The time stays accurate.<br />I do find the watch to be really huge and very heavy. I understand the current trend for oversized watches, but I prefer smaller, lighter watches, especially when there is the chance of catching the watch on various things at my work or knocking the clasp open. In my view the size is not very practical, but that is, of course, subjective, and dependent on how and where you use your arms., Awesome!, Bought as a gift, it was a gift, Not a bad beginner set, but the packaging was loose when I got it, and the watch opener is too wiggly to be of any use.  That's what I was really in this for, but it just won't open up anything that isn't already easy to open with fingers, and I've scratched a watch or two trying to use this., The watch was not on working condition when I received it and needed a new battery., Beautiful! just as described...shiny, will wear very well over time..:), So this is a beautiful set. The watch itself is gorgeous. Item arrived on time and are as described by the seller... Well for the most part<br /><br />Some of the bands feel soooooo cheap, even cardboard like. Really really thin and somewhat fragile. However I have used half the bands already and even though they feel cheap they don't look it.<br /><br />All in all a great purchase. If you're looking for robust leather bands however this is not for you., a touch of elegance. Clear dial face. supple band. Not gaudy. Just right., I like the look of the watch. Not crazy about the band, planned on replacing it before I bought it. Difficult to see day and date, easy to read time. Good quality for the price I paid., This fit my Timex Expedition perfectly.  My old, original band finally broke and I needed a generally cheap replacement.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I wear the Expedition outside while working on the lawn and getting mucky and dirty, and this band had stood up to that daily abuse., I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves it. So far every thing is good the watch looks nice and working fine., Handsome, weighty but comfortable., typical Seiko product, good looking, dependable, excellent value., A+, I bring these Invicta watches overseas when I travel to give as a quality gift, and everyone loves them,, The watch arrived very soon but didn't work at all.  None of the buttons would work and the illumination wouldn't come on.  It was stuck on an alarm setting and power saving mode and wouldn't let me change screens.  Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement because it is a very nice looking watch.  Hopefully the next one works.  Something that I did notice about it though was that the Casio box that it came in was taped up a lot with scotch tape like it had been dropped or damaged in some way., I don't get the great review at all.  I understand it is a cheap watch, but it really looks the part.  Flimsy band and tiny watch face.  For the price it isn't terrible, but I was expecting more based on the reviews., I noticed it stopped about a week ago & just discovered that the return date ended 4 days ago so apparently there's no recourse.  Will not buy watch online from Amazon again.    [...], Easy to read and use. Need it for work. Work graveyard, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Beautiful watch.  Very heavy and not cheaply made at all.  The band is a very soft leather so it will not bother skin., Truly a beautiful watch. Too bad I wasted it giving it to an ex. He ended up selling it. Wish I would've kept it for myself., One of the prettiest Betty Boop watches I've ever purchased.  Just ordered another watch for my mom.  Would highly recommend this to all Betty Boop  fans., I always wanted to buy this watch and I'm so happy that I eventually did., There are actually a lot of things I like about the watch and a few I don't.  I like a day and date function which this has but the date window is very narrow and makes it a little harder to see for older eyes.  I really like the blue sunray dial, it is a striking color.  The strap isn't bad looking either and is a little stiff right now but I know from experience it will soften up.  The strap is relatively short and will only fit up to a 7 1/2 inch wrist.  The case size is a little smaller than I prefer now having fully embraced the large watch trend, although you can't really call it a trend anymore as many brands are making larger watches now.  The minute and hour hands are little thin and can be a little hard to see, they are a polished metal and the best way to see them is use the reflection from any light source.  The comical detail I referred to is the hour markers have luminescence on them but the minute and hour hands do not, which essentially means putting luminescence on the hour markers served no purpose because you would not be able to see where the minute and hour hands are at night.  This would be a decent starter watch for a young man and is recommended for those that intend it for that., The clock is very beautiful. Thermometer not accurate although there setting. I do not like that the glass is higher than the body so easily scratched., I only wore the watch for a short time, shortly after getting it (around a month of wearing it ) it already showed wearing off of the multi colored band. Obviously the watch wasn't an actual Micheal Kors brand because my friend has the same watch she bought from the Michael Kors store in Destin, Fl. and hers shows no sign of the same wear. We both do the same job and wear them to work. I loved it until it showed these signs of being non-authentic when it was advertised as an actual name brand watch., Time slowly waned and backing fell off much of the time. Tossed in trash after six months., My son lost his other Timex at the beach. This was a replacement that became an upgrade. I love that I didn't need to use the instructions to set it up, it all showed up on the face., Purchased two of these for my twin sons, who have a problem with &#34;bedtime&#34;, and had previously used illuminated alarm clocks as improvised flashlights to stay up surreptitiously reading late into the night.  These fixed that issue, however, they also both broke within a few short months., Worked perfectly, the first time. I read a tip suggesting I pout a little oil or WD-40 on the link pin I wanted to remove. I did this a few days for I used this product. The pin came right out. Great purchase., This is a gorgeous watch.  No other words to describe it., Link band quality is very bad watch looks good., Terrible product. I wasted my money on this it is cheap.You cant remove the links either., Keep it short and simple. This is a must have ABC watch. . If you got the extra dough, grab a Suunto. But the PAG240 does everything I need. I would have worn this thing down range.  Solid., Looks lighter in person, got it for a nice price so that's there, best watch ever, Very big face! Lots of fun. Lots of information. Hard to remember how to use all of the functions, but I keep the manual handy. Not made with women in mind. Do not understand why manufacturers totally ignore women when creating these types of watches., Sweet watch perfect for all purpose watch! Green and black really pop! Hope the pics help this watch is by far my favorite!, I love the watch.  Size is right. The straps are gold quality leather.  Only thing I am not crazy is the weight of the watch itself, it feels fake., I give it two stars for a few reasons<br /><br />First off I am pretty sure I received a defective watch. My reasoning for saying this is because<br /><br />- the bar where the watch latches onto was bent out of place making it extremely difficult to get the watch onto my wrist, and even when I could get it onto my wrist it had trouble staying on.<br />- After a few hours of wear I noticed the watch had stopped telling time. I reset the watch but it will only work for half an hour or so before it just randomly stops. I figure it must just be the battery and it is easily replaceable but I really have to go out and purchase a battery for a brand new watch?<br /><br />I have never had any other problems with a Nixon watch in the past so I figure I must of just received a defective one.<br /><br />But other than that the watch is very nice looking and stylish. The black on black looks sick! But I am still extremely disappointed., Falling apart within weeks of purchase.  All watches have same generic innards, but for exterior to be this cheap, and not worth effort and cost of warranty that was supposed to be free, is really disappointing.  I should have gone with timex., This watch is great, the movement, the case, the band, it all comes together in an attractive and affordable package with a 5 year warranty to boot. I set it to the atomic clock 6 days ago and I am only 1.5 seconds ahead this morning. The craftsmanship and quality of this timepiece far exceeds the price. EcoDrive is an amazing technology.<br /><br />This is a must have every day watch for any collection., Looks really nice. Wrapped really well when I recieved it in the mail. Not as quiet as I would like it to be. But quiet enough. The plexiglass that covers the watches are kind of hard to open. You would need to place your fingernail on the crevice to flip it open. The controls are a little confusing to how to turn off the one you want to turn off, when trying to get one of the watch from the 4. It's still too early for me to rate the motor on this. Hope it will last. Not bad for the price., I wanted a B&R style watch without the price tag, and this is what I got. The band could be a little longer and softer (it's thick and stiff), but it is genuine leather where it counts. The case sounds hollow and thin compared to my Diesels but it's very light for its size. I was hoping the numbers and arms would glow, they don't, so this isn't night friendly. Overall I bought it for style and low cost and it suits the price tag., Thanks great watch and service! Perfect watch, affordable, simple,  durable, water resistant. Put it  on and never take it off for 2-3 years when the band breaks.Though this time the light  doesn't work but small detail since it's hard to find my favorite watch., DOES NOT WORK! Adjustment pins will not stay in the tool when turned upside down to apply to the watch...so therefore TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, Really cute watch that goes with everything.Is large though but if you need cheater glasses like me then large is the way to go.don't need the glasses to see the face of this watch., While this Timex is a lower end watch, it meets the need of everyday wear when you Don't want to mess up a more expensive timepiece.<br />And, it keeps time accurately., A lovely band, but I needed a 16mm and only the ends reach 16me., Love the watch, but the battery was dead when I received it. Had to get a new battery on a new watch., It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., Well the watch is cute and it works however the battery has a leak and left a chemical burn on my wrist., Second precisionist bulova watch I buy, love everything about them, planing to have them in all colors, These are great straps for the money. I have a few other deBeer watch bands.. Never disappointed. The contrasting white stitching looks pretty sporty on my Harley &#34;FatBoy&#34; watch from 1993.. Perfect match!, Fits well and functions well., this is much bigger than it looks online but i always wanted a sporty analog watch and i really love this..also feels really durable, I really like it with my apple watch, it high quality leather with a nice shiny stainless steel buckle, here is photos with the apple watch., Came with NO INSTRUCTIONS. The picture on amazon shows a blue-ish white light on the watch however, the lights are only red and doesn't change colors. I should've paid more attention to the bad reviews., Fantastic idea but broke after 4 weeks., I bought this watch after being NAUI scuba certified and let me tell you this is my favorite watch ever. The high  Quality  that is put into this watch  really shows it features a screw down crown which can be a little bit difficult to get used to but all you have to do is unscrew the crown and it helps keep the water out whenever it's screwed in this watch is movement powered  using an amazing Japanese Patton and I would never ever ever write a review other than what I am writing due to the fact of the high-quality made by Swiss company that is meant to look just like the Rolex submariner .  Best dive watch I have ever owned would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a dive watch and is unsure five stars  also features one of the best glow in the dark features I have ever seen works just using the light and then it glows very highly so that you can easily see it in the movie theaters or in bed or underwater it that is dark . Comes in a very nice cheese box by Invicta is amazing, only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it didn't come with Manuel to explain how to set it. asides for that one nip pick its amazing so far and will be part of EDC., Great watch! In fact, I might need to order another watch because my 7 year old daughter keeps stealing it and wearing it!, One of the nicest synthetic bands I have ever had.  Easy to size.  Hard to find 22mm strap. Very comfortable., excellent quality, easy to read dial, Day, Date and illumination. The Wife is Pleased and that is what Counts!, like it .., Very Cheap, I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, perfect for me., Nice watch. Well built. No problem in the shower, pool or sailing the open seas. On par with any 51% Swiss made automatic. The Amphibian was too small for my wrist so my wife took it and it looks absolutely fantastic on her. I will buy other Vostok watches in the future. The only thing I found annoying was the branding. There is none. Some have the &#34;b&#34; Vostok logo while others do not. The graphics vary from watch to watch. These watches would be far more valuable if Vostok developed a consistent branding policy and stuck to it., I like the watch a lot and recommend it.  But you should know that it's often hard to read in low light., Too big for my wrist. Wish they would have posted sizes so I would have realized size before I bought., Love this watch, it's tiny and comfortable and I've ordered it multiple times (after losing it). Pretty water-resistant too, Simple, functional and attractive. Plus this watch is an excellent value. I do wish that either a push button or fold over clasp was included, but overall I'm very satisfied with this watch., Nice looking watch. Seems to run a bit smaller in length. My other silicon watches have more elasticity to them. Overall, I'm pleased., Love this watch!!!! Would recommend to any guy! I've received so many compliments on this!!!, Simple design.<br />Light.<br />Awesome.<br />Sexy.<br />Buy it now.<br /><br />Reviewed by a Whale., This was a really pretty watch. However, the clasp did not work properly and for the cost of this item, I would have expected it to., Pefect, exactly what I wanted, The watch works, but the band is uncomfortable., Beautiful gifts for the grooms people at my son's wedding. thank you!, This watch replaced a similar Timex that lasted many years.  I expect the same from this one.  I like the easy to read dial and nylon band., Bought this for a friend I owed a favor. Told him 20 years ago I would but him a batman watch if he stopped crying.lol, Slick feels expensive. Awesome for business and perception. Money well worth spend, baaaaaaaaaad, For the money nice watch very accurate to the second over the one week I have had it. Purchased it for a travel watch not wanting to take my expensive watch on the trip., Very easy to wear. Been to the beach still working, I like this watch a lot, largely because it was a gift from my mother.  One thing is that the vendor could have sent a little instruction sheet about how to change the band., Pins are made of the cheapest and softest metal there is.  I can't complain about the cost, but the metal used for the pins could be a little stronger.  One time use as pins not only bend, but break almost immediately., I absolutely love my new watch which is far more beautiful than even pictured.  It is amazing to wear for any event and very dressy looking much more expensive than the cost., The first watch was damaged during shipment. Seller responded immediately to my email (complaint) and offered to send a new one. I love these watches and have one in nearly every color so,I was very disappointed when I received it. I expected to be told to kick rocks when I complained since I paid next to nothing for the watch to begin with. The second watch came within days and was packaged much better and now I have a cool lime green watch in my collection., This watch was a little larger than expected, but once hubby got used to it being larger than his other watches, he LOVES IT. He continues to get compliments on it and loves how a gold watch matches his wedding band. Very sophisticated and a good weight to it. It's easy to see the hands and we would recommend it!, I love this watch! It doesn't come stiff, and fits really well. I have a very small wrist and it fits mine. The shipping was fast and when I opened it I received the dw box as well. Favorite women's watch so far!, Worked really well.  I had to remove a few links from a newly purchased Invicta watch.  Sure, I could go out to the garage and find a nail set and some pliers, but I'd just spent over $100 on a watch and didn't want to scratch it up.  So, I bought this and it made life a lot easier.<br /><br />One critical note:  The piece that lets you set your watch band in it and screw the pin out is very flimsy.  Mine had two plastic pieces on either end that promptly fell right off and I had to glue them back on.  Without those pieces, the whole knob falls apart and can't be used for removing pins.  It was an easy fix, but annoying., This watch is beautiful., Had an older model for years, the band gave out before the watch(still my outdoor work watch) love the upgrades and the efficiency of the solar ring. No better watch for my needs, I like a lot. I recommend it., Very attractive watch. Looks expensive, but isn't., Excellent time piece. Keeps perfect time. Great look. Gets lots of compliments. The only negative is the trijicon is not as bright as I anticipated., My girlfriend loved this watch. Highly recommended., It is another typical &#34;Junk Made in China!&#34;! Water gets in freely from front side and back side even when you sweat a little !, has lost time once already. Ok since., I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. He loves it! It looks way more expensive than it was. He gets compliments on it all the time. It holds time well, as long is you wear it consistently., I own several Android watches and love them all. They keep good time and make quite a statement on your wrist. I like big watches and this one is 40mm square., Fantastic costumer servise..thank you so much., Once again Nautica has a winner. Smart and stylish for the yachtsman. Real watch quality in the case design and the nautical flags are a real nice touch. This watch is a super buy!, Watch is as expected, very good one.. no problems at all Packing was very poor.. got the watch stand broken... either broken during shipping or it was broken when packed, This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke when I found I could not get it to run but I looked at the stem and found I could not pull it out to set it,after looking at 2 or 3 times I was able to see a small piece of plastic wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. .My wife just loves it I also got her the Gold one as well . My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., Keeps perfect time., Nice but worked exately for 10 months... and now i cannot return it<br />I do not recommend this, Battery is not working when I got it. I had to return it and Amazon sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, after several weeks the battery died again., Just got it and i'm happy with my purchase, it is a beautiful watch, will update with performance in a couple of months, as for now I'll give it 5 stars., The watch looks great, but it runs slow. Once a week I have to set the time cause it is 30- 40 minutes (!) behind. I would give the watch 4 stars but if it isn't measuring time accurately it fails it's purpose., Nice looking automatic watch, it look like it should cost more then what it does., Great watch. Comes in an awesome case. Good idea for an anniversary gift. Every man will love one of these watches., It's the perfect fit for my watch!, For those looking for a more affordable alternative to a designer watch, this looks like a good choice. My daughter wanted a watch that looked like my $6300 ceramic one, and this fit the bill. Since a 15-year-old doesn't need to have that kind of money on her wrist, a look alike for $75 seemed like a good idea. The watch is really beautiful, and the ceramic band and dial remind me very much of my more expensive watch. The bezel turns nicely and the face is very attractive.<br /><br />Now the bad news: To begin with, the crown popped out like it's spring loaded and it won't pop back in. I though it might be a screw down crown, but it's not. It will pop back into place, and then immediately pop back out again. Which means, whenever it's being worn, it will catch on things and pull the crown all the way out and basically stop the watch. I have tried and tried to get that crown to stay in, but no dice. Adjusting the band was also a nightmare. The two piece pins connect in a space so tiny I had to purchase a band adjusting set to fit the pin hole. The crown is really the problem though. I realize it's only a $75 watch, but for that money I expected the crown to stay down!, I got this watch at W..M..t because they did a price match.  All my coworkers have &#34;shock&#34; watches, so I went full lemming.  I've never liked the layout of Casio (because I'm so accustomed to the functions of the timex/ironman), and I don't like the bulkiness and busy face of the G-Shock.  I've had it for a day now, and it's going well.  I am an ironman watch loyalist, and I've only had one lemon in my life.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what it takes to take full advantage for &#34;shock&#34; because my non-shocks seem to take a regular beating with no issue.<br /><br />PRO: It's not overly bulky and it fits my smaller wrist well because it still feels light.<br /><br />CON: I wish it had the same OI as the non-shocks.  I don't understand why I can't have three alarms (it has one), and three time zones (shock capable of two)<br /><br />CON: Unlike the non-shocks, the glass is a bit more raised, which then casts a shadow over the display.  Before I could just glance at my non-shock, but now I have to tilt my wrist.<br /><br />I'm not a watch snob, and I haven't made any investments in watches.  One day I'd like to get a few so that I can pass them down., Susenstone® Elegant Women Girl Watch Rhinestone Quartz OL Ladies Wrist Watch Red: I bought this originally for a friend, but wound up falling in love with it when opening it. It is elegant, arrived early, the gems are sparkly, the band seems durable, the color is the same as promised and it is easy to set the time on. I also enjoy how the numbers are Roman numerals instead of just plain numbers. I'm very happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., broke within the first 2 min. Still works ok and I was able to do the job but some of the parts are really poor quality., Purchased watch from Jewelry & Watch Exchange. Received watch around /or after April 24 2015.  Haven't worn it much so I did not notice until after 4 months later, the watch had stopped working (  No abuse to it).  Either the watch was old stock and the battery was already and was drained before it was shipped to meor the watch is of bad quality.  I do buy a couple of watches every year but I have never had a watch which last less than 6 years (with battery replacement every 2 or 3 years)..  This watch just died in less than 4 months!!!!  Not sure if it is the seller with old stock or just bad Geneva design. Disappointed that I wasted my money.  Choose a different brand or a different seller since the watch is not returnable after 1 month when I read the warranty on Amazon from non-Amazon sellers.  Very sad., Nice watch. It's much better than I expected and I'm very happy with it. I wear it almost everyday., Very disappointed in this very cute watch, which  is a really beautiful concept, but a total fail on execution.  I've had many Casio watches and another Baby G and loved them all. The photo for this product is completely misleading.  There is no way you can see the digital windows, although the photo makes it look like you can.  The back light does not light the digital windows.  If you're just looking for a very durable watch, sure, this will work fine.  Casios last forever and keep great time.  But, if like me, you actually need to use the stop watch or alarm functions, forget it.  I read the other reviews about the difficulty in seeing the digital windows, and thought they must be talking about the very minor contrast issues that I experience with my other Baby G.  No, I held the watch under a reading light and still could barely see the digital windows.  Completely unusable for me as an exercise physiologist who monitors exercise and recovery heart rates, and times exercise bouts.  Maybe even more outrageous than this design is the fact that I have to wait for the seller to &#34;approve&#34; my return.  Being that the product did not fit the website description,  you would think that's an automatic return.  Think again.  I gave it two stars because if you don't need to use any of the functions, it's a really cute watch, Very nice, good looking and a quality product. Instructions could be better, but the product is grat, Batteries dead before wearing., This looks like a child-size version of my Fossil Cecile watch, so I bought it for my 3 year old daughter as a look-alike. I knew it could too big for her, but for the very low price, I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it arrived almost shrink wrapped around the latch and I struggled to get the plastic off of it. I must have broken the latch in the process, although it might have arrived that way. I decided not to bother returning it, but threw it away because the broken latch was unsafe., 1. Too thick for s dress watch 2. Not very accurate. 5 minutes gain already on my watch. 3. Inconvenient watch strap. The seagull rodina is a much better one, I have bought this style of watch four times.  The only downside is it's hard to remember how to reset it. Save your instructions, I scanned mine and saved on my computer.  I didn't really NEED this watch, I bought it for the instructions.  Now I can set all three of my watches correctly.  It's durable and water resistant, runs like a TIMEX!, Excelente!!!, I love Timex Weekender watches for the ability to switch watch bands to match just about anything. I own several in different face colors and sizes, and my favorite in both sizes is the grey face. I love that the second hand matches the color of the watch band that comes with it. I think I like the women's size best, but the selection of band colors is more limited. I wish both sizes had more colors in the bands and that they were more readily available., My husband has had 2 of these watches.  Both have quit working within 6 months.  It was guaranteed for 1 year but Timex has you send it back and enclose a $20 check  Not worth returning for the cost., Dial broke after return policy term expired., Loved it!! Perfect watch. It looked just like the picture! I'm super happy with this purchase!, Does everything literature says it does. Setting instructions easy to follow from web download., A very handsome product. The only draw back is the weight. It's kinda heavy, Nice looking watch, however, it took longer than specified in the instructions to get enough of an initial charge for the watch to operate and keep accurate time., Attractive and large enough I can read it, Watch was too heavy returned it.  Looks nice., i will to buy again, My god poor quality this item, Looks good, but the works are terribly off time, must constantly adjust it. Might have a watchmaker look at it., Very pleased with the High-Fashion look of this watch.  Price and value is unbeatable., What a poor product!  The bezel fell off in the pool, not long after the colored fob on the dial disappeared (I know not where). 40Nine should put its money into a better product, rather than full page advertising in The New York Times., Cheaply made, disappointed., The face of this watch is over-sized and I LOVE that!!!  No loud ticking, easy to read, comfy and not pinchy.  A+, The dial is ok, it is a bit too dark to tell the difference sometimes., Perfect Fit., Cute and lightweight!, It's not A1 quality. In my opinion it is a B minus quality. It's wrist bend is toooo cheap looking. It's 'second' hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine. With the issues I metioned. it is not worth the price I paid. I am disappointed about the quality. I was expecting better than that. Will not buy from Sinobi again., The battary watch is speed did, I've worn Timex digital watches for at least 30 years now and have been a devotee of their Triathlon line, but lately I have been unimpressed with them as it seems their quality is slipping.  The last one I had has had issues ranging from the black trim that surrounds the display coming off to it occasionally resetting itself and the display going blank for no apparent reason.  I decided to try Casio instead this time and don't quite have the love for it that I had for the Timex watches of old.  I am liking the five different alarms that can be used, but wish that the chime was louder and lasted longer.  As far as how it is built, it seems fairly rugged and put together well, but time will be the deciding factor on this.  I like the solar charging feature and hope that it works as promised.  So far I've had no issues with that.  My main gripes about it is that I wish the display was bigger and the volume of the alarm.  There is a lot going on as far as display features and other trim pieces, including the photovoltaic cells that circle the display and reduce the usable space, but it seems that Casio could do a better job of reducing the clutter on the display and increasing the size of the digits.  But all this could be attributed to my pushing 60 also, as well as the volume objection.  I have a smaller wrist so went for this watch because of it's size relative to some of the other watches Casio makes.  That was one of the things I liked about the Triathlon watch from Timex, it's size as well as an easy to read display and as alarm that was plenty loud and long.  Last complaint is the light for the display, being the old side illuminating light.  Couple that with the smaller digits and it just isn't up to the readability of the Timex. After all this nit picking I have to say that I still like it though.  The band is more comfortable, the look is good and the functions work well.  Maybe in time after this one wears out I'll go for a different model that is larger tosee if the screen is more readable., The girl I gave it to said She likes it., it came broken, I didn't bother to send it back, thought It was a awesome item, very disappointed, I bought this watch because the mineral crystal was to resist scratches.  The crystal made the watch much thicker than the usual Casio sports chronograph and it proved less resistant to ? use than any, repeat any of my last 4 Casios.  Most of my Casio watches last 6 to 8 years and I go through multiple watch bands during their lifetime.  This watch lasted one year.  It still keeps perfect time but the crystal is so opaque I can't see the time in sunlight.  I have always loved my sports chronographs, never take them off, but this one was not in the ballpark of my others.  I'm 68 and arthritic so it's not like I'm incredibly hard on them either., Arrived on time and is really a nice watch.Large face and easy read numbers and really who doesn't like Mickey Mouse., Battery doesn't last., My go to watch. I love the look and how easy it is to use. However, setting the correct time and date was not easy. The online manual is not very helpful., Compared to a lot watches I own this watch feels cheaply made. I'm used to a much heavier watch but if you're looking for a lightweight watch then you might enjoy this watch., This watch was very carefully packed and in a very nice box. The watch itself is beautiful and unique. 1. The wood is real and it is well polished.  The band is put  together very carefully and it is not scratchy. 3. The color combination and the contrast on the dial are very tastefully done. 4. The label of the company is clearly shown on the watch, however,  it fits with the design--not as an &#34;in your face logo.&#34; I don't like when the logo takes over the product. 5. The clasp is easy to open and to close. Push on the side buttons to open it or to close it on your hand. 6. The band is fairly wide and comfortable. The dial is very easy to read and no detail is out of place. It's a joy to look at the  watch, instead of the ubiquitous &#34;clock app&#34; on a smart phone. :=) I am very impressed with this company. I've always received clear and prompt responses to my questions; the few items I bought were always carefully packed and clearly inspected.  I hope that the company will continue its tradition in providing outstanding unique products and service. I found a few things for my wishlist already. :) I really enjoy wearing this watch., I'm disappointed with it's appearance of the coatings, and lack of any illumination of, the face or hands! I rashly threw away the box. Before I thoroughly inspected the product! So that's my fault!, Yes, the band on this thing sucks, cheap leather, I needed to replace a silver watch that I lost. This one was a bright and shiny silver watch that was attractive in its simplicity. When I received it, the face was a little larger than I wanted, but I quickly adjusted to it. The band was a little stiff, so it didn't move with my wrist as well as I would have liked, but I adjusted to that also. I only wore the watch about five or six times. One time the watch fell from my wrist onto the ground, and I assumed I had not properly snapped the clasp. I made sure the clasp was closed tightly and wore the watch the rest of the day without incident. Another time it fell off my wrist but landed in my lap. Again I think I did not snap the clasp hard enough. I vowed to always double check the clasp, but started to wish the watch had a protective chain, so it couldn't fall off my wrist. One day, I wanted to protect the watch from getting scratched while I was doing something,  so I removed it and put it into a QUILTED pouch in my purse all by itself.  When I later took it out to wear it, I found that the pin had fallen out so one side of the band had separated from the watch. Now this watch that I wore only a handful of times needs repair. And even if I spent the money to fix it, I fear the pin will fall out again. When I attempted to return it, I was informed it was too late to do so., Excellent product, I really recommend it!, I love the watch but thankfully I have big hands and wrists because the watch is a pretty big watch but it's a great watch, Wasn't  too thrilled, couldn't figure  how to set time. I followed instructions but was not successful. So nestles to say the kid isn't  using it. Have to figure  out another time., A birthday gift for my oldest daughter.  She has quite the Invicta collection, thanks to me.  This one is a little more traditional and girly.  She loves it and if she's happy then I'm happy., I really liked the design, but the time gets wrong if not used the watch for a long time.<br />I have many watches, and when I try to use this watch after leaving it one month,<br />The time is always not correct., It looks nice, just like the pictures, but none of the three smaller dials works.  The minute, hour, and second hands all work which is all I need, so I'll keep it, but I can't give it more stars because it doesn't work how it says it should., As a nursing student, this product is perfect for my needs.  It fits beautifully, and has the second hand that is necessary for taking vitals on my clinical patients. A digital watch would not work for my needs as I need the second hand. I love that it is stylish as well.  Cute colors in the face, while white to fit the requirements of my school uniform, great looking band....originally thought it was going to have a gold buckle as seen in the picture but it came with silver...however the seller did send me a gold one andI am very happy...THANK YOU, Perfect for my 90-year old mom.  The numbers are easy for her to see., Looks nice, seems durable and easy to switch out., It's perfect! Fits right and has no damage, I bought this as a gift for someone who is really petite. The watch is REALLY heavy but you can tell it's crafted well. But had to send back cause it would have been too heavy and too big for the person. I didn't want to keep it cause I thought it would be too heavy for me. Maybe better for a man than a woman., It's not A1 quality. It's okay for the price., I bought this for my daughter who just started running on her HS cross country team.  She likes the style and it is very easy to use.  Nice product., Impeccable function and looks along with accuracy. Haven't bought this watch from amazon but this piece comes highly recommended. The hands may look out of place being coated white and not steel or glossy and maybe an initial let down. Fits as a right size on medium sized hands and looks bigger than its 40mm., Didn't give this purchase enough forethought, and it is somewhat uncomfortable., I purchased the GA100-1a1 because I needed a nice rugged watch which was also stylish with good features. After reading reviews and checking out videos and pictures, I picked this one up. Im really happy with the purchase. It looks great with its sleek flat black band and black designed face. Comes in a nice gshock tin can that could be used for other purposes.<br /><br />The manual is easy to use with clear instructions and has various languages. The two digital areas on the left bottom and right bottom of the face can hold different information such as lap time, day/date, seconds, world time, &#34;home time&#34; and other various options. Its comfortable to wear and shock / water proof.<br /><br />There are a few things I personally wish were different. The hour and minute hand is not irridecent or illuminating at all. It appears as it should be. The illuminating face light is pretty dim and its a yellowish color. A bright white led would have been a better option. I kind of wish there was a second hand, but theres a digital seconds option for the bottom right digital area. Sometimes the hands can block it so its not visible. These are more-so personal options of what I would like, and not a flaw of the watch.<br /><br />Overall great watch for the price!, Seems to be a bit stiffer than the original band that came with my<br />SKX171 dive watch (not seikos best by any means) but is holding up<br />well.  No cracking or splitting so far., Very elegant and beautiful watch. It is simply worth the price., Love my new watch! Very stylish and classy!, Excellent strap for the price, however, the pins that come with the strap are somewhat inferior. They kept popping off which lend me to replace the pins with stronger ones., I bought this to replace an extremely similar watch with a plastic strap that had died after years of constant use. This one doesn't need to be washed as often as the plastic, which smelled sweaty and weird every few months.<br /><br />I find it weirdly comforting to carry one electronic device that cannot malfunction due to programming or the Internet. Unlike some friends of mine with watches that cost hundreds of dollars, my watch always tells the time. It never says &#34;The device has stopped responding, please reboot&#34; or any other error message., It was a birthday gift for my son who is an executive . Suit, tie, and watches are his everyday attire. The packaging of the watch was classy and sturdy befitting the watch itself. The watch had weight and a high standard appearance. I would purchase another Stuhrling watch any day., My husband bought this for me as a gift before starting my internship.  It's a nice watch and the opal finish on the face is beautiful.  I have small wrists and generally like smaller/slender bracelets and watches.  This one fits nicely, not too bulky and easy to read., A very beautiful watch. I carry it always, you need wind it each day but very handy if you need keep track of time. I tend to use up my cellphones battery often so this is a handy time piece., I like this little alarm clock. Got it right next to my bed., Been battle testing it offshore. No problems a little complicated so I need to read manual more. Over all very tough if you work in the offshore industry highly recommend as the alarm is actually a good strength. It is a big watch and so you will need to get used to this., Have had the watch about 3 years...watch still works great albeit a little scratched up...description claims mineral crystal display in one place and plastic in another, like to know which. Band has failed and it seems to make more sense to replace the watch than replace the band. I don't think the vast majority of owners ever run out of battery life., love it..  beautiful addition to my Fossil collection, the jewel bezel sparkles the numeric dial is gorgeous.  Highly recommend., excelente, I bought this watch due some issues with other brands where water proof was not really water proof, this watch works perfectly., The watch face is gigantic and heavy.  It is definitely made for a man.  Have to return it because the huge size makes it very uncomfortable and unwieldy.  Hard to use a computer keyboard.  Too bad.  It looks really attractive in the photo, but the women's model is no smaller than the unisex., Good simple watch. Would like it better if the side buttons were recessed so they wouldn't get pushed by objects I am handling, It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., used to replace battery on water resistant watch - worked easily the 1st time used and highly recommended if you want to replace your own batteries, For a watch it is good like all Timex watches. However the watch I received from Amazon is not the one pictured here which has a medium brown and and nearly white markers and hands. The combination in the picture is very sharp looking it is not what was delivered. What I received was a different color combination of much lighter color brown band and pale yellow hands which has much less visual impact. The one I actually got is OK but does not look like the one in the picture. If it had looked as it was presented I would have given it two additional stars., Nice watch, but I returned it because it is huge.  The pictures don't depict how big this watch is., The watch is more yellow color than I would have liked but it fits well and works. It did not look like the picture in my opinion which was a lighter gold color.  I have since purchased another slim style gold watch that I prefer to wear instead of this one.  It is still a nice watch just a bit off in color for my taste anyway., 😍😍😍😍😍, I have only 3 negative comments. 1.  The manual is printed in almost unreadable tiny print.  2.  To use all of it's functions you would have to spend 2 hours reading the manual.  3. I worry that it won't get sufficient light to keep it charged.<br />Otherwise it works fine and looks good., This watch is very easy for children to read and the strap on it is easily adjusted. My daughter loves it., I bought this watch mainly for the dial. I didn't really like the band so when I ordered I checked the width and ordered another one the same size. Imagine my surprise when I received both items when the band in fact is 22 mm, instead of the 23 stated in the specifications.  I would highly recommend being as accurate as possible when it comes to the information of the products you are selling, now I'm stuck with a watch that only like the dial, and bands with no watch to use with.  I'm not really happy, where's my money??!, Really like the look and function. Good value., Bought this for my daughter for christmas.  she loves Frozen, as all girls. She also loved that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  She also likes that she can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way she could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when she is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., excellent watch with excellent service, Splendid watch.  Looks much more sumptuous in-person than in the picture.  Check online auctions for lower prices., This Invicta watch is a sporty stand out.  It fits my slender wrist well, works well and looks good.  The time and date are easy to set, unlike some Invictas, which can be a challenge.  Love it!, Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended., Attractive but hard to read hands as they are the same color as the gearing. Needs to either be worn every day or put on a winder because it has no ability to go without movement for more than a day., Easy to see.<br /><br /> Also, red and blue lighted dial. Loud alarm., The band lasted maybe 7 months before it broke in two places.  I expect a lot more for something of this price and supposed quality.  I've gotten more from products of much lower cost., The outer ring with the numbers on it is made of really flimsy plastic. The watch face is made of plastic too. With an active kid it would probably be scratched in no time and the band is just a thin strip of fabric. I like the concept of the watch but the execution is poorly done., very beautiful watch, Not worth it .. it's just a dark screen protector it doesn't add any Privacy..  I took it off right away, For the money ($52.62), this is a delightful watch.  The size is right, the heft is right, the finishes are sophisticated and clean, it's comfortable; all in all, a great addition to the collection.  I removed five of the six links with pins and the fit, thanks to the micro adjustments on the clasp, is perfect (very easy to size at home).  The legibility in bright light is not bad.  Black hands on a black face is not the best combo, but the white luminous inserts on the hands help a bit.  I like the screw-down crown as well.<br /><br />Downside?  The numerals and markers are not luminous.  My bad for not reading thoroughly, but it makes the watch almost impossible to read in low light or darkness.  That's a feature I rely on in a workhorse watch, so this is relegated to occasional duty.  The other issue is the internal rotating bezel.  I love the feature, but it isn't locked or ratcheted, so it is easily displaced by normal movement, and, therefore, useless.<br /><br />I like it.  At that price I really like it.  But it's so close to being so much more!, As described. Nice, cheap way to change the look of my watch..., Love it! The transparent inner ring makes the clock look as if it was custom colored for my office; blends in wonderfully! Suspect this would work with virtually any wall color.  Plus, constant second hand sweep; no ticking., I bought this for my husband, at first I didn't like it and was worried he wouldn't either. It seemed so huge and excessive with the gold finish. But after looking at it again I really like it now. It fits well on my husband's wrist - not too big at all - and he is very pleased too.., I bought this watch for my exercise purpose, since I am an outdoor exercise lover.  My dripping sweat could do nothing to this watch.  It is also attractive., Round design and plastic materials are ugly, squeaked, and broke after a year. Did the job for the time being but i am happy and not surprised i'm replacing it., Formy dad, Really nice looking watch.  The atomic auto set function works great.  No setting and time is always correct., Very attractive watch which people notice and comment positively about. I bought it to keep track time at home on my recent trip to Asia. Per Murphy's Law, of course, China, Taiwan and Singapore are currently all 12 hours from the East Coast so it was kind of superfluous. But still cool and there will be other time zones. I was not sure whether this was a wound or battery watch until I got it. Both movements are battery driven and seem to work well. Band is OK quality but in line with cost. Overall worth the price., Super cute bracelet but the straps are too long., Very classy and expensive looking. These pics don't really do it justice. I  was going to buy a couple of other designer  watches to add to my collection. I have an Armani watch that I love dearly, a silver And platinum Rolex that is a gift from my father, but this watch is clearly now my favorite watch. As a matter of fact, I will not be buying anymore watches for now. I brought a brown, a white and yellow  bands to switch things up a bit. . It feels  now  like I have several expensive watches.The silver face goes with any color band to match your outfit. I saved a ton of money  just buy buying different bands and a spring bar tool to change these bands in less than 10 secs. Love it, I loved the look of the watch. It was exactly what I had been searching for for quite some time. The speed of delivery was fast so no complaints there. And the return to Amazon was so fast and efficient it left my head spinning, what a professional outfit.<br /><br />All that being said, I was SO VERY DISAPPOINTED in this watch. It is the first watch in my life (over 65) that when I went to set the time the stem pulled completely out of the watch!  Talk about being shocked! I stuck the stem back into the watch but of course nothing worked. I was heartbroken. I was tempted to make this a one star rating but I don't hate the watch and I still wish it had worked but to be honest I am now gun shy about buying another. And that saddens me,, I never wore watches because they would feel to tight or my wrist or just look odd but I decided to try it again and thought I would get a cheaper watch first. I love this watch, it's not too tight, it looks fabulous, and it can really take a beating! I am not a gentle person and this watch has not yet scratched and I've worn it every day for three plus weeks so far! Someone I know who has a $100 arch has scratches all over theirs and is jealous of mine! If you want a classy watch that will get you compliments every day you wear it get this one!, Bday gift for my son.  He likes it..hopefully its durable enough for military life., My wrists are extremely small so I had to bore some additional holes for the band to fit.  In addition the face of the watch does seem a bit large on my small wrists, but that adds to the funkiness and unusual design of this watch., This watch looks gorgeus. A bit heavy, but not more than more traditional watches of this size. Mechanism is silent. Built quality is more than enough for its price. Color is bright light cupper, a bit similar to golden, but not (it's more discrete). Beware: this model is the only one without luminiscent effect in the dark, from the Eclipse serie., This watch is the biggest single piece of garbage ever produced. The chronograph quit funcioning about a month after I purchased this watch and they want $36.00 to repair a watch under warranty. Do not buy this!, Attractive watch.  Do wish it had more than one alarm., Got watch for my grandson. He is enjoying it., I was looking  for a watch with a large diameter face. Not something crazy like some of those you see that look like they are on steroids, but a manly size face with a manly sized strap (typical ones seem to have a small face and strap so it seems more like a girls watch). So I came to learn that I am looking for 50mm diameter size in the description to satisfy my 'look'. As far a the watch itself, yeah, standard digital watch with alarms and face light up at night features. It's the look that sold me., a, Functional and of fine quality.  Includes numerous tips suitable for opening everything.  A must have for checking movements prior to purchasing high end antique timepieces as well as for replacing batteries in the children's department store watches., I really don't understand.... I need more information how set time arlam ... It really didn't come with good instructions., [[ASIN:B00S0D9J74 Bessky® Luxury Fashion Crocodile Faux Leather Mens Analog Watch Watches]] In reality it looks inferior than what it looks in the picture. But what am I complaining about. I only paid $3.60. So what the hack, I give it four stars., Tough and attractive. Keeps excellent time.  Saphire crystal hasn't been scratched in 2 years.  Alarm is very audible unless you have lost your high-frequency hearing., I wanted a larger dial, but not a man's watch. I love the idea of the solar battery, and it is keeping perfect time. It is a terrific buy; just check Seiko's website., This was actually a gift for one of my good friends- the look on her face when she opened it was priceless!, A nice band, on the darker side of stainless, more titanium looking...just so you know what to expect., This watch is exceptionally  light, color blue is very  bright . The size is perfect. Nice looking.  Fun piece., Couldn't be happier with it!  Color was exactly what I wanted., Arrived on time and works as promised. Note that it mostly works at night rather than during the day so do not be surprised at the lack of activity during the day. It does not want to over-wind the watches., Wife loves it, therefore makes a hero out of me. Thank You Seiko and Amazon., I Love the watch the color, band the look the way it fits the Invicta is a watch tha i will be buying for<br />myself and my family, THANK INVICTA great price SEE YOU SOON!!!!, I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch's bracelet to be very well made, comfortable, easy to adjust, but a little bit heavy. Citizen sells this watch with a lighter titanium bracelet: [[ASIN:B001QFYKTA Citizen Men's JY0050-55L Blue Angels Skyhawk A-T Titanium Eco-Drive Watch]]. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., my first dress watch, received quite a few compliments, looks like an expensive one, Other reviews of this watch face design mentioned difficulty behind able to actually read the hands as there wasn't enough contrast between them and the face.  This is not the case with this iteration, the hands are clear against the face and very easy to read even in low light.<br /><br />I have very thin wrists and was able to remove 5 links easily and the watch fits perfectly.<br /><br />The finish of the stainless steel is &#34;stained&#34; in appearance but has an almost soft powdery feel against the skin.<br /><br />I haven't tested out the 600ft underwater depth limit yet, nor do I plan to, but it's nice to know unlike everything these days, that getting it wet won't ruin it.<br /><br />Very pleased with my purchase., This watch is just awesome. I always loved swiss army watches and this one is no different. Perfectly sized snd feels heavy and sturdy. In all honesty it made me start a watch collection, Perfect, it what exactly what i was looking for, I (female) bought this for myself because I like larger watches .I get a lot of compliments. Peoples attention goes right to my wrist and  it matches everything. I would give it 5 stars if the dial indicators & numbers glowed in  dark., Man, love this watch. OUTSTANDING. for the price your paying. It's a gem. Looks almost like a Bell&Ross, except, you don't have to pay the extra thousands of dollars. Maybe later on, the real one will come into play. For now, very happy with this watch. Looks extremely well. Well built, and arrived in a nice watch box.....Buy it. What are you waiting for?, I got this watch because I was looking for a vibration alarm that I could wear and it was one of the only ones I found.  All its features work well, but it is a LARGE watch.  I am a woman so my hands and wrists are smaller, but one of its side buttons has actually rubbed my skin raw a couple of times.  The manual is understandable and it's easy to set up the watch the way you want it., This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke, but I looked in the plastic bag the watch was in and found the pin that holds one end and after a little bit of effort it was back together. It also appear to not be running until I found a very small pices of plastic that was wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. The wife just loves it I also got her the Platinum one as well and had less trouble with it, as all I had to do was remove the little piece of plastic under the stem which holds the stem up so the battery is not drained during shipping. My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., Yup, worth for what you paid and more, Changing watch batteries is often frustrating due to the difficulty of getting the back of the watch into place. This device has solved the problem with a selection of dies for putting pressure on the watch & the back without risking shattering the crystal. It gives the necessary leverage for popping the back into place. Bravo!, Just what I wanted, Exactly what I needed and ordered! Love my Amazon experiences!!, Bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and Geeeeeez this watch is nice! It's very flashy and shiney.<br />It was packaged as brand new with the original Caisio box.  I hope he loves it because I sure do! And shipping was fast !, This watch is awesome!! The strap is very easy to adjust just need to cut, it has magnets to close the strap., This watch keeps moving, but loses accuracy within 5-10 minutes. Completely useless. It's fully wound, so it's not just stopping. It's about 8 minutes too slow for every hour, and I've had to adjust it too many times now. I can't trust it. Sending it back., IF you have a Space Grey Apple Watch Sport， I highly reconmend this one . The black one matches the gray Apple watch almost perfect.<br />At first , I worried that for this low price the band might look and feel &#34;cheap&#34; but it's quite the opposite.The adapter is really easy to swap out with sport band allowing me make the watch dressy or more casual based on the occasion.<br />The buyer also ship to me the band removal tool which helps me to shoten the length of the watch band., My favorite watch  -  thanks for making women's  -  the men's were to huge for my wrist, Beautiful!, only one worked, Doesn't keep time we'll over any period of time. Must be reset regularly., I've got two comments on this review which describe a breakage I encountered shortly after receiving the watch. In case you don't read those comments, be aware that I did need a repair but that I was rough with the watch and the repair has held for some time now (and would be easy to repair again in the future.)  This is a very bulky watch. If you require a slim timepiece it is not for you. It is a very blingy watch, it will catch attention, if you don't want that all the time keep a more subtle piece for backup use.  This is THE best timepiece I have ever owned. I do joke sometimes that it is like wearing a wall clock on your wrist, but I am big and bulky so it suits me handily.  The most important feature for this for me was the chronograph. I use this everyday. I find it reliable, easy to read and use. Be aware, the hour dial tracks in half hour OR tenth of a second increments. After one half hour it begins tracking half hours. The minute hand tracks up to 30 minutes (this is when the half hour replaces tenths of a second on the hour dial). Don't be confused if you are under half an hour and the hour dial spins to a random number when pausing timing, this is the tenth of a second you are on. It (the hour dial hand) spins fast for the first 30 seconds then rests.  The only thing this is missing is a perpetual calendar. I feel like, with the bulk of the thing, it could probably include one, but I do have yet to find anything even remotely slimmer with retroactive day of the week, date of the month, and a chronograph that has even slightly decent ratings in this price range.  I wouldn't mind knowing exactly how much weight in gold the gold plating adds up to, and the &#34;crowns&#34; are &#34;gold-tone&#34; while the bezel and links are 18k gold plated.  Invicta Reserve pieces have absolutely proven to me that they are worth the investment!, Really neat for the price, a lot better quality than I expected. Works great.... Alittle trouble with learning how to set, but you can look it up online. All-in- all very nice. ME and my son bought one each., The straps are totally useless.First of all, they are very poor quality and they started deteriorating from the very first week.Second,they are not wide enough to fit the Santos XL chrono( as promised) leaving a gap in between .This was my first go with Amazon and I really feel cheated., Cool and easy to use watch, Poor quality, This is my fourth Invicta Russian Diver's Watch.  I'm very happy with it. These are very sporty watches and yes, they are big!  I won't be doing any deep sea diving , just the occasional swim and a lot of dish washing., I like the watch. It's big enough to read without my glasses. My only disappointment was that the pink color I see on my computer is not the same pink as the actual watch. The watch is a darker pink. No biggie but I would have preferred the color in the picture which is a brighter pink., Amazing product and seller!, recommended!, First let me say that the accuracy of this watch is nothing short of amazing! I own several (read TOO many!) Swiss and Japanese watches and this ranks right up there with them.<br /><br />However,I gave this watch 4 stars because it is rather bland for the price (about $250.00 on Amazon).  In fact, I have some Timex watches that look more expensive.  I find it hard to believe that full retail is around $400-$450.  The blue second hand and domed mineral crystal are nice touches but the polished and buffed stainless steel look somewhat cheap next to them.  The black strap, however, is very nice and soft.  I do think for the price a sapphire crystal would be in order.  I would even pay a little more for It.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do like the watch and am happy to have an Accutron II in my collection.  Love the sweeping second hand.  Looks like an automatic without the winding!  And again, the 96B213 is incredibly accurate.  You won't miss any meetings with this watch., I have extremely small wrists so I had to remove several links.  After removing all the links that I could the watch sill did not fit snugly,  but it's a satisfactory fit for me.  It looks more like a bracelet as the band is a bit wide on my small wrists, but I like that effect.  It is elegant so I would not recommend for everyday wear., Came in with dead battery which had to be replaced before gifting..., I don't like it at all in person.  Looks online ate very deceiving.  It has a very small face, and the material looks cheap.  I'm very disappointed.  I have purchased many watches online never had a problem.  This is awful!, I'm very satisfied. This watch is cute AND inexpensive. Just like in the picture. I do wish it had gotten here a bit quicker, but it did come on time., Excellent handsome watch. I have a digital version and I really like this one. To program just walk through instructions step by step. English doc can be found in: http://support.casio.com/storage/en/manual/pdf/EN/009/qw5174.pdf. No problems getting time signal to sync with and solar cells very sensitive and worked great., After having to send back the first one, because one of the two motors involved in rotating the watches was not working, the second version seems to be working properly. I love the fact that I can store up to 16 watches in this case and that it can run on electrical current or batteries., You get what you pay for. It was real cheap so I figured I'd check it out to see if maybe it had any quality, but it's something you'd win out of a gumball machine., I read a lot of poor reviews for this and other products like it but I found it works great. It is quiet and keeps my Rolex running! I would definitely recommend this item., Purchased  for my son for his birthday.  The watch is very nice and he gets many complements on it.  He loves it., The watch wasn't able to sync the time ether on auto or manual mode. This was a deal breaker for me after all what good is to have an atomic watch if it doesn't work. I had to return it. I'm not sure if this is a common problem with this model but I have a ten year atomic Casio and it sync every night without problems., Elegant, handsome, and beautiful men's watch. Comes beautifully and very safely packaged - perfect condition. It was easy to set the date/day and start wearing it immediately. I purchased the blue dial model, with rotating bezel and magnified date. Has the look and feel of a more expensive watch. You will love it. Stainless steel is the only way to go, and not heavy.  Prompt shipping and arrival, as is Amazon's tradition., I'm wearing this instead of my Tag Heuer-- even for summer swimming & beach because my tag battery is more exp. to replace than this whole watch and this looks as nice if not nicer., I love Anne Klein watches; always have.  This one is beautiful and so easy to remove and put back on.  I get compliments each time I wear it!, A, Keeps decent time. Is cat-themed. Not too expensive.  Just what I was after. The watch face is faceted: the highest point is in the center, and then the clear cover slopes away from the center in pie-wedge shapes towards the outer circle of the face. Sort of like the roof of a circular tent. It looks fine, but it can throw the reflection a bit. If you look at the image, you'll notice the light shining on the face is in a Pie-chart-wedge-shape. That is the shape of the cover. It isn't a problem, but it takes a little bit to get used to it., It's not A1 quality. I consider it B- quality. It's second hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine., The design is amazing I love it but the watch is very very small, I bought it for me but I'm not going to use it, because it looks like a women's watch, I just wasted my money, I have been on the search for the perfect MK watch that suits me and my needs. I have to say I've found it. The face is not too large and not too small, just perfect. The silver tone is not too flashy and overstated, just perfect. It has a separate second hand which I need as a nurse, and the color will not tarnish from all the hand washing I do all day long. Perfect enough for everyday and going out. I highly recommend this MK beauty., Does the job done!, Thanks to this, I don't have to stop by a watch shop anymore. It is very easy to use., I have this model watch for a long time. I buy a new one every few years as mine gets beat up from wearing it to work everyday!! Amazon have the best price on this watch...., Bought this watch for my son's graduation and he loves it.  A beautiful, classic style.  Came extremely well cushioned and protected during delivery,, This was a GREAT watch. Did everything I expected it to do (keep time, of course) and more (it has a stopwatch feature and a night vision light). Sadly, the band broke, so I rigged to to continue to wear it, but it fell off of my wrist and is now forever lost. Definitely worth the price, wasn't worth the shipping time, though., Super cute, feminine watch. Dial is easy to read and the multiple colors of metal means I can wear it with silver or gold!, very googd, Love this watch. The face is definitely large. It is very stylish, comfortable. Very happy I made this purchase., First, this is a well made watch.  Second, the picture doesn't do it justice, it's a great look with a heavy feel.  Third, be aware it is larger than I expected!<br /><br />The box and watch itself is very nice.  I worry when choosing gifts that the item might arrive in a cheap package and no matter the price it will make it feel cheap.  This is not the case.  The box and instructions, watch, tag etc. are very nice-an expensive feel.  I love that, especially when choosing gifts.<br /><br />The watch is well built, or at least at this point that is how I feel.  It is heavy and feels durable.  The buttons/knobs at the side of the watch are easy to use, even for larger hands.  The face is huge and easy to read.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this, just be aware it is larger than you might assume!, Needed one of these for years., i swim daily with it on. Able to see time @ night. It does its job as advertised. solid buy., I was really surprised at how great the quality was for such a low price. It is although, a lot larger than I expected which in turn resembles a more masculine watch. I would have preferred a more petite version. Still working on figuring out how to operate the many functions. The instructions could be better. Good quality watch., to heavy, as advertised, For the price it was a steal! However, slow shipping hence the 4 stars. I have big wrists and I'm using the 2nd button. If you have a small wrist this may not work. Very happy!!!, It was real nice watch for my husband gift., Got this watch for a trip to a certain city notorious for pickpockets and didn't want to risk my Tag. Love the clean basic style and did it job. The face is a bit on the small size for a man, but not too bad. Its biggest fault is the strap. It is far, far too short. I am 6'0&#34; and 180lbs, and the band barely fit my wrist and had to use the very last hole. So if your wrists run even moderately big, you may want to steer away from this., 100% recomendado, not to big, but still heavy weight watch ! But it looks really good, excellent option to choose., Horrible watch the bands broke while I tried it on the strap is peeling I only had it for a week had them check the diamonds that are real is like one small spec you can't even see these are those 5 dollar watches you get In downtown, This is a terrific slight improvement in a classic. I have been wearing them forever and every once in a while I need to replace.  Wanted one with a count down time for cooking a several models did not have.  When I searched for one with a count down time I got one listed at $150 and I could not figure out what it had otherwise that would justify more than $125 more than this watch.  Casio, please don't stop making this watch.  Thanks for improving the way data are shown on first screeni.  Time day date year all very easy to see., Awsome, Looks perfect and seems to keep perfect time. I'm a professional Santa and planning to use this as part of my costume. It's the small details that can set you apart from the crowd ..., The watch I receive don't work very bad watch !!!!!!!!!!,, Beautiful watch, perfect oversized watch and it's not to heavy., Beautiful watch that can be worn as a dressy rugged look or can be worn for everyday wear.  I had so many compliments on it from women in the office.  They were looking for a women's version of the watch (smaller face)., Unfortunatelly I didn't like it. I wanted it for  my Swiss Legend watch and it was too much different quality., Product was defective. Stopped working after 2 weeks., it's a big and unique stylish watch from Columbia, the shipping was prompt. when I took the old band off and compared it too the new one I noticed the new one being a little smaller in overall size, ie., not as beefy as the original. also the buckle is chrome on the new one. original is black. I switched buckles. the new band does fit and I'm using it. the question is: has casio &#34;slimmed down&#34; their bands? or was a co_____f_it band shipped to me., Easy to use. Works on Jewelry and glasses that have never been cleaned., Glass covering fell off after a year, It's just a waste and give a slight accidental blow and stops working.<br /><br />es un desperdicio apenas y le das un leve golpe accidental y deja de funcionar, The exterior of the case is of good quality.  The interior of mine was in shambles, the cardboard partitions were all knocked down most likely do to shipping.  I was able to reassemble it and seems to be holding up well for now.  The huge disappointment, and the reason for the 2 stars, for me is that the &#34;removable pillows&#34; are missing.  Without the pillows the watches just flop to the bottom and look messy.  The photos show it with pillows and the description says &#34;with removable pillows.  To not include them is wrong.<br /><br />Thank you,, i like it, I was told the recipient liked it, Watch band completely broke off pin., Great watch, a bit tedious to set up, but once done it runs on its own. The watch is rather large, but you barely feel it on your hand. Highly recommended!, This watch is beautiful. Solid construction, clean crisp face. You can see the time clearly. I have a collection of 20 watches and this one just fit right into the top ten., nice little watch. 4 star for the watch and 5 star for the services. Really nice no question ask. Recommend for buyer who want something reasonable price with a cool & good looking watch., ike the watch, it is a real conversation starter!, Excelent!, The watch is excellent. After a month of use, it still operates, keeps accurate time, shines like new, and the face isn't scratched.<br /><br />This watch feels solid to the touch and it has a premium construction. It came in very nice packaging with a felt covered, hard watch case.<br /><br />My only issue are the link pins and the lack of instructions on how to remove them. I've owned 40+ watches and have adjusted the size of the band on nearly every one. I do it so often that I purchased a highly rated jewelers tool kit specifically for removing link pins and resizing watch bands. The Alexander watch uses a pin that I've never seen before. Not only were there not instructions in the user manual, you can't find anything on the Internet (I tried Google, Facebook, YouTube, jewelers forums, etc). I'm extremely tech savvy and I couldn't even find a hint. Even when looking up &#34;every type of watch pin and how to remove it&#34;, there was no mention of this type. To make it even more deceiving, there are etched arrows on the inside of the band which is supposed to always indicate that it's a push pin and that's the direction you remove it. After hours of trying and searching the Internet, I had to visit 3 jewelers before one figured it out. There are flat head screw holes on both sides. That's typically cosmetic, but not in this case. In order to remove the pin, you need 2 people and 2 tiny screwdrivers. One person has to hold one side of the pin still while the other person screws the other end out like you would a screw and bolt setup.<br /><br />I'm not sure how there are not explicit instructions somewhere to explain these unusual pins. I had the watch for a week before I wore it due to this. I'd have to imagine some less patient people returning this watch out of frustration. That is the only negative and I would've rated 5 stars if instructions were able to be found., Time will tell., Invicta makes very stylish watches, I buy them to give as gifts when I travel overseas to family, and everyone appreciates receiving them., I was looking for a Velcro band for the watch but I got this awesome watch for this price totally worth it..., Work horse of a watch. From hiking to work to just walking this watch has the ability to do it. At one point it fell in water and was completely fine., I have been using this pocket watch with watch attached to a leather key fob. The fob allows the watch to be protected by any coins or keys I may have next to it in my pocket.<br />This watch, within about 2 weeks had most of the finish rubbed off of the metal back plate. The plastic crystal is also easily scratched or marred just by walking around with it in my pocket throughout the day.<br />By the way, I only take this Gotham with me 2-3 times a week, so it sees only light to medium wear and tear.<br />Yes, the watch keeps good time and the thin size is a good feature. I have another pocket watch that I bought for about $14.00 at a well known discount superstore and it has held up much better over a longer period of time than the Gotham. Save yourself some money and shop around, unless you have to have an extra thin pocket watch., These watches are large .However they say water resistant,THEY ARE NOT!!I wore in the shower and it actually filled up with water.I have cheap watches I wear to do yard work and in the shower that hold up better than these do.So as a novelty I guess there okay but I wouldn't buy again or wear doing dishes or in the shower.I didn't want something I have to remove when I'm near water., I have small wrists so I had to take some links out but I really like the watch., very happy, The clip that holds the little door shut wears out on these after a little while.  Had to super-glue it shut.  Luckily, you can still tell the time.  This occurred with several of the different styles I purchased for my partner., Very nice, better than I thought, but read the instructions before you try to set the date!, My son is absolutely in love with this watch. It is very good quality and allows the links to come out to fit a smaller wrist, Very cute!!  My g'son loved it even though he can't tell time!!, Extremely disappointed with this strap. I purchased this strap at the same time as one from another company. The other strap arrived in less than a week. This strap took 3. On top of that, the quality was horrible. The strap is very thin and the rings feel very flimsy.. Stay away from this strap., this was a gift for my cousin, Son Loves this watch.  Light weight, classy, dressy. just what my 18 yr old son was looking for.  He would purchase again., I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, This one i liked., 100% recomendado, This watch was perfect! I'm kind of in love.<br /><br />I use an Apple Watch for my day to day, but this little watch actually gets used a lot. It is absolutely perfect for any outdoor activity or other situation when you need a seriously tough little watch. Its also a perfect travel companion.<br /><br /> According to Casio, this thing is only supposed to be water resistant, and isn't really meant for swimming. Well aren't they a bunch of jokers! I have swam for hundreds of hours with this watch on. In pools, rivers, lakes, oceans, and believe it or not, THE DEAD SEA!!! I am truly flabbergasted by the quality for how cheap it is. I honestly expected to break this watch over a dozen times by now, in fact I never bought it to last, it was really only meant for one trip.<br /><br />Just so there are no surprises, the materials are what you would expect for a watch this cheap. Its all plastic hardware, and a simple thin resin strap, but somehow it has all held up. It still feels cheap in your hand at first, but after a while wearing it, you will realize how tough it really is., Nice looking watch easy to watch the time and date, I love Skagen watches and have had 3 of them consecutively.  I liked the durability of the watch because I was a teacher and always knocking my watch around.  I have been a very proud owner until I just gave this watch to my cousin for retirement.  It's too late to return it because the gift was not sent right away.  My cousin received it and shortly after noticed a small crack in the crystal.<br />I never had heard about the crystal cracking defect.  Both my cousin wanted to buy a Skagen until they read about the easily cracking crystal.  My watch was just the opposite!!!  I didn't know there was such a controversy until I started to read many reviews on Amazon.  I like Skagen and hope they find what is causing this terrible blunder to their watches.  I still would  buy a fourth Skagen!, Excellent product, battery dead, product defective...returned for replacement..was on time, I did love this and got lots of compliments but the band was rubber and split after only a week., Beautiful buy., perfect for my 7 year old grandson.  He is still learning to tell time, My son likes it. It's a little cheap and took a long time to ship., Love this watch! It's the perfect size and the fabric is nice and sturdy. Definitely recommend​!, Just got my watch today. I'm love it so far. Is it much bigger then the both of GD6900 30th anniversary model that I have. I would said is approx the same size as the Mudman and the Rangeman that I own. Also package came everything perfect too, as everyone are G Shock collector or owner. Always want there packaging arrived nice and prefect. I would highly recommend this vendor. Thanks again Amazon., This is a real disappointment, I bought this a month ago and the red color had faded and streaked. I was not happy with the rose gold buckle, there no description that it came that way and does not match my stainless steel watch, My daughter loves the watch. It goes with everything, is attractive, and water resistant. Very nice., This watch is fun and easy to read! The retail orice listed is definately off, but worth the Amazon.com asking price!, Great looking watch. Keeps excellent time, has not lost a second yet. I resized the bracelet myself using directions I found online, which was fairly easy and took &#60;15 minutes. Its quite hefty and the case is.. substantial. Its actually quite thick but I like that. The middle portion of the bracelet is raised and polished which is very good looking. If you're not looking to spend thousands on a Rolex, then this is a very good choice.<br /><br />Here is the link to the directions I found for resizing the bracelet: https://justasmallblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/how-to-resize-a-seiko-collar-and-pin-watch-band/#comments, The watch arrived on time. I was floored at the case and removing the wrapping this watch HAD the best looking face and resin body I've ever seen. A bit hard to see hour hand in low light,set timer to 3 seconds on face light and in low light hit the light button and hold your hand over the face about LESS then an inch and both hands will be seen. Practice a few times adjusting everything until you get it. Other reviews complain about this low light problem but do nothing about it. It's. An extremely fine watch worthy of finding a fix to solve it. I get complements all the time. And price, where did I get it. Best watch I've bought since the last 4 Gshocks I bought., It's a gift for my friend. I just wonder why it could only connect to IPHONE, why not Android phones?, 不能防水Not waterproof, its not well fineshed , parts of the bracelet is without painting. not elegant at all, it looks cheap!!!, Arrived on time.  Excellent watch.  I used it at work and fishing.  It tells me what the tide is.  I only have to input some data where my location is to show the tide info., Grate product for the price, Excellent merchandise!  It was delivered on time in a beautiful black box suitable for gifting.  With adjustable pins built-in to its strap ends, anchoring the straps to the watch case was a breeze.  There are no enclosed instructions or illustrations for how the band is supposed to connect and close/open, but, being a wizened old codger, I was able to figure it out in a few minutes.  I could have solved the puzzle quicker if the clasp that opens and closes to secure the retainer pin into a chosen hole on the strap had not been so tight.  Because I was afraid of breaking it, it took me a while to determine that the buckle (clasp) had to snap upward and pivot along the tiny pin hinge at the base.  An embossing on the inside of the strap reads, &#34;Genuine Alligator Hand Made USA.&#34; The outside of the strap is obviously made of dyed and polished alligator skin, but the inner band material may be man-made.  The strap is handsome overall, and opens/closes quickly and securely.  The strap is stiff on initial use but molds to the shape of the wrist after a few days of wear., My niece likes it, This band is perfect for my watch.  If there were other colors, I would order them immediately .  Woven bands allow me to fasten at the place I need for my small wrist., fun watch, It is not good quality , quickly lost color and 3 weeks, It look elegant, works perfect. Shipped immediately., I like the look and comfort  of the watch but I did not know it was a watch that I had to wind up every day.  I expected a watch that had a battery., The band is very stiff and cheap looking, but the face is beautiful and is very classy., Dakota claims to have excellent warranties, but not so.  I received one of these watches for Xmas a few years ago, and the first time I took it diving, the crystal came off the front, and thus the inner workings rusted. The watch was supposed to be waterproof.  When making a claim, I was told:  (1) no matter how I received the watch, I needed to prove purchase before they would warrant; and (2) only the inner workings of the watch are covered by warranty, with the crystal NOT covered at all, so they would charge $20 to repair.  Buy a different brand and check the warranty before purchase., I have become a bit of a watch collector but needed to replace my everyday watch.  I have at least a dozen (mostly Swiss) watches ranging from diver to dress for various occasions.  However, I've been a fan of Casio for their combination of value + quality + accuracy since my 1st G-Shock in the early 80s.  I certainly intended to spend more than thirty two bucks for my EDC but I liked the design and couldn't help myself.  I've had it for 6 months now and don't regret it a bit.  The feature set is perfect and setting the analog time is simply a function of the watch synching itself to the digital time.  That definitely wasn't the case with my last Casio digi-ana.  That one required you to hold down a button for a very long time since it only moved forward, making the fall DST change a real hassle.  Another problem I encountered was that when approaching the 10-year limit of the battery life, the accuracy of the watch suffered quite a bit rather than the watch just stopping.  I'll watch for that in a few years but for now it's only off by about a second a month which is good by any standard., This watch is a little larger than I expected. But I like it, especially as bigger watches are stylish now too., I have always liked a analog & digital combination watch. I like always having the correct date (instead of manually adjusting it for months that do not have 31 days). This watch is great. In addition to the ana/digi face, it has atomic time adjustment and a solar battery. The face isn't huge like a lot of watches of this type. It's sleek and comfortable., Good quality, though I expected better quality as Stuhrling is a high quality brand. Everything seem very nice finished however the seconds indicator is poorly designed relatively to high quality finishing watch. I was expecting overall better wuality watch!, great product, good weight and solid feel. To small for my wrist is the only issue, Amazing watch for the price. I get many looks from other watch lovers., It has kept perfect time for the week that I've had it. Very easy to read. The hands don't glow for very long but that's nothing. I wanted something for water sports (fishing and swimming) but I'm not sure if I'll actually wear it swimming because the screw down crown seems to come a little loose on its own, I have to give it half a twist about once each day. Maybe loose is still enough for a water seal, I don't know. I have large wrists and normally get frustrated with short straps but this strap is large enough. This is my first bigger watch and I'm still not used to the size but my wife tells me it looks good so that's that. No ticking noise unless I really try to hear it. Second hand hits its marks perfectly. For a Casio, this is great.  Update a few weeks later. The glass front (I think that is called the crystal) cracked for no reason at all. Now condensation is inside. I'm glad I did not pay more. Back to the drawing board., exellent, I had my first G-Shock for 8 - 9 years and then gave it to my son a couple of weeks ago. It still works perfectly and looks good. I went ahead and bought the Japan version with the carbon fiber insert band for one reason. I had to replace the band on my first G-Shock twice, because both bands cracked after a few years of use. The non-carbon fiber insert band on this runs about $60, so I figure I'll spend the extra money now and hopefully this band will last a long time -- saving me time and maybe some money.<br /><br />I've only had this watch for a week, but I already love it and I am trust Casio G-Shock!, Cheap quality and not manufactured to last. If you are looking for a decent quality watch band, buy something else., Excellent watch. Eye catcher and very com<br />fortable., The width of the watch would only be pleasing for a woman (or Caitlyn) and I don 't know if I got a returned watch but the band is only barely long enough to fit my male wrist whereas most men's watch bands have extra links, and I frankly bought it for a woman based on its appearance (it really is a gorgeous jewel with a sapphire face that sub $600 Apple watches don't have and 100 meter water resistance that would drown any Apple product). The case is 11 mm thick due to kinetic recharging mechanism which may not be petite enough - one concern is if using arms to animatedly gesture while talking, the reeling sound of that mechanism may be noticeable. But hey - never have to open the case to replace battery! I just noticed it's not currently available - it was a fantastic deal, It works but it is a very large faced watch., This watch looks so nice.  I wear it daily. It has just the right amount of &#34;bling.&#34; I never shower or swim with it. The crystal face is very durable and in 10 months, I only have one small scratch on it.  HOWEVER, 2 of the numbers have fallen off and are free floating around in the watch's face!  The second hand gets stuck on the numbers and then won't work.  I can't believe it.  What a huge bummer!  I would not recommend buying this product!, Simply perfect. I had one before. Also casio but not Gshock and I wasnt pleased. This one is perfect though, exellent, Was a Bday gift for Hubby. It fits very well and is easily adjusted. Looks exactly like the pic. He loves it., Oustanding watch  for the money. Very durable and bendable., CHeap - was returned., I bought two!  I have  7 and 9 year old granddaughters. It runs really large,.... perhaps for an adult size wrist. I'll have to take it to a jeweler to get it sized. But, it's a quality watch., Awesome product, great quality. Be aware that if you are being this for a kid or a person that's very thin than it may look a bit bog on them because the watch is a bit thick itself. But I recommend it to anyone other then that., Excellent watch. Accurate, easy to read, nice features, stylish, solid and dependable. Easy on easy off. This fricken watch rules. I'm going to buy another to wear on my other arm like ah stew-kah., Love this watch!!  Wear it to work everyday it's indestructible and looks nice at the same time:), Excellent, Very nice watch probably the best watch in its price range fast shipping couldn't be happier ..., I have had this watch for less than a year and am disappointed with it.  The second hand no longer ticks off each second, but jumps about 4-7 seconds each time it moves.  Somehow it is able to keep accurate time but, as a nurse, I need to be able to reliably view the seconds passing.  Thinking it was simply a dying battery, I replaced that, but it still doesn't work correctly., I really like the watch however, the calendar function isn't working correctly.  I have had many watches with this function and never had one t hat I could not adjust correctly.  Should I return it and get another?   Good news..... I turned the time back 12 hours and it all works perfectly!!!!! I love the watch, Very pretty watch.  Had to go to jeweler to remove a couple of links as it was quite large when it arrived.  I haven't really had it long enough to know about longevity, etc., I've only had it for a short time,but thus far it has exceeded my expectations. Every thing seems to be as advertised., This band was a fine addition to the leather band that came with my Moto 360.  The tools included were a nice touch but mostly ineffective in getting the original band removed.  Fortunately, I had already purchased a much nicer tool for @$7.  Once I finally learned to get the pins installed (I'm not a jeweler), I gave a good tug on both ends of the band and they felt secure.  I wore the watch several times without incident.  I can't seem to find a way to remove one link that I think will give me a snugger fit on my wrist but it is otherwise very attractive and comfortable.<br /><br />My problem is the band suddenly just dropped off my wrist!!!!  Lucky for me I was just pumping gas and the watch landed on the band itself when it hit the concrete so no damage to the watch.  What was worrying is only 15 minutes earlier I was riding my motorcycle on the freeway.  Had the same thing happened then, the watch would have been history!!<br /><br />I do not know how the watch came apart, the link that fits to the watch (that holds the pin) did not show any damage and when I got home I was able to install a new pin into the watch.  I will keep an eye on this band and not expose my watch to any potential situations I could loose the watch (like wearing it while riding) until I have some confidence this won't happen again., Got it for a gift for a friend love the way it looks I might just get this for my self can't have too many watches., It is fashionable and it looks and feels good. I would recommend that the bracelet be made more flexible. The battery delivered with lasted only one week. Useful to know that it uses 377 type., need to improve belt quality. looks like the belt and battery will constantly need to be replaced, eventually leading to another watch purchase., Cute. Poor stitching, so cool !!!!, It fits my paw1300 but somehow it looks like missing something from the band. I'm going to keep it for extra. I'm still looking for same bands that came with the watch., Purchased for my daughter before going to college.  She loved the size and the look of the watch, unfortunately the crystal face fell out after a few months.  The watch was not dropped or abused - obviously a manufacturers defect.  We contacted the company and they informed us that the crystal was not covered under warranty.  The cost to fix it was more than the cost to replace it.  Very disappointed with Armitron customer service.  All that to say, it's a very nice looking watch, but don't expect the company to stand behind their product if it fails., Very comfortable to wear.  Easily read. I love my watch!, This is a nice-looking, easy to read watch.  Looks good whenever you wear it.  Fits well -- not too tight.  My wrist is 6 inches.  I like it very much., The watch arrived damaged because it is not keeping the time and the needle timer is moving along without pressing the button., Not really blue. More green., The watch is heavy on my wrist, and there is no back light or glow making it difficult to read in low light.  After 3 weeks of normal wear a chip developed on the edge of my glass, humidity and moisture then condensed on the inside of my watch face and then it stopped running all together.  Normally I would give this one star, but I contacted the warranty folks and they had me send it in for repair or replacement.  I have not receieved the watch back yet, and so I may change this to one star eventually.  The other knock I have is on how easily the 'ring around the face' scratches.  I had this out of the box for 24 hours, just wearing it around the house and somehow it picked up a scratch on the ring.<br /><br />That being said, I do like the styling., It's a beaut!, As with all Casio watches this one inb particular has its good and bad features.  The watch is classy, different, and I know will last...On the negative side I found the so called illumination to be almost nill....and to date some of the programing a bit difficult.  Should have been easy to set<br />the time for this city by zeroing in on the key city for the region..........did not happen.............will keep trying though............<br />I have had numerous Casio watches and they last through showers, nursing, teaching swimming, thats is why I prefer one of these to<br />an &#34;expensive&#34; watch., Its a mans watch!, Purchased as new and was used and scratched with missing links., This watch is just what I need. I bought this watch to wear at work and for more rough and tumble activities. Love the metal loops as I always break the leather and rubber ones long before wearing out the band. Love the slip through band as I can replace it myself without tools. Love the indiglo as I sleep with the watch on, and can light up the face to quickly see what time it is. Love that it is very easy to read with or without glasses. I don't get how people are saying that the watch ticks loudly. I can barely hear it when I hold it up against my ear. I am 55 yrs old however and I don't hear as well as I used to. The watch face is brighter white than it appears in the add, which I like but some may not. I don't care that there is no date window as they are usually too small for me to see, and need to be constantly corrected on analog watches anyway., Nice design.<br />However, the digital clock can not be seen clearly at night, EXCELLENT, Cool watch, Excellent product, Average quality, not for professional use but adequate for the home owner., I love the face of this watch, although the band did come off easily, that didn't worry me too much. The glass of the face is what broke very quickly.. I've yet to replace it., Stylish, Accurate and comfortable to wear.  What more can you ask for?  And yes - reasonable in price., Came damaged. Plus it is too small for the average man;'s wrist. I think the concept and the style are really cool. Wish it had a larger circumference. The numbers are easy to read and it is unusual. Had to send it back., Just what I wanted., Junk, Elegant and simple design. Love the rose gold finish. Very feminine, strings come out of sides and always have to cut off, Better looking than any of my Dad's very high end watches. Keeps time just fine for me and it is very light weight in your hand but feels very sturdy on your wrist., It is an interesting looking watch. Works well so far., This watch has a nice, thin design and looks great. But like a lot of watches around the $100 price level, it's not durable. Within two weeks of wearing it the crystal popped off. I hadn't dropped it or banged it against any surface -- it simply came off, as if it hadn't been attached correctly in the first place., Some people are just too picky with watches. I think this watch is reasonably priced and doesn't look cheap at all. It all depends on how you style it with your outfits. The gold might possibly fade through time with the band's constant contact on skin. This is based on the band material. I've had a gold ALDO watch with the same price as this, and the gold faded slightly through time because the band material was also alloy plated with gold. But then again, you get what you pay for right? At least you didn't spend a ton of money over something that'll still fade. Happens to MK gold watches too! (Experience from my friend's genuine MK watch).  This one actually looks like an MK dupe though, but who cares? This watch is cute!, I love this watch. It's so simple and understated, and looks great if your a smaller dude like me.<br /><br />Things to know:<br />-The light works really well.--The clasp is adjustable by sliding back and forth on the band, not the links of the band.--The band is very thin for a metal watch, at least half and possible a third of the thickness of many other metal linked bands.--The description says the case is metal, but it is metallic plastic thing at best. Feels cheap, but looks great. Probably doesn't take a scratch well, but I don't know yet. The back plate is full on stainless steel.--I get compliments on it all the time.--It can be a bit of an arm hair puller if you're sensitive to that, but I think most metal bands are.<br /><br />UPDATE: Case is holding up well and may be stainless after all. Hairs stopped pulling out after some initial adjustment period. I still love the watch!, I have opened my watches in the past with a pair of needle nose pliers. More times than not, I have scratched the back of the watch trying to open it. This tool is inexpensive, built well and more importantly - it works. I wish I had bought one sooner., Lovely watch with a classic look. It's pretty impressive to get an automatic at this price. I still opted for the [[ASIN:B005UONA6W Tissot T0636171603700 Tradition Men's Chrono Quartz Silver Dial Watch with Brown Leather Strap]] instead for a more modern look, but I was really torn between choosing this on and the Tissot Tradition Chrono. I would definitely consider this for a second watch., Interesting, military-inspired design but the watch -- as sold -- has two flaws:  1) the luminous material used on the hands and small hour markers is inferior (very weak) and 2) the thick nylon band is uncomfortable and increases the thickness of the watch significantly.  I own and have owned many Victorinox watches and they are typically excellent.  I won't hesitate to purchase this brand again -- just not this particular model.  I have no doubt that others may not have an issue with my two complaints., Fantastic watch, goes well on every occasion and you bound to get compliments for this one.<br /><br />Accurate timing and the best part is the eco drive technology that surpasses all!! I would say it's a must have in your collection  with all its bells n whistles :), Very nice watch. I gave it to my grandson, who is using it while running track. It is very similar to my G-Shock, except that it is MUCH lighter & does not have the sync to the atomic clock feature., Broke the second my son put it on.  Never returned it but other than that it was ok., The lens broke from the inside! So now the hands won't move. It was dropped or banged around. This is an expensive watch, this shouldn't have happened after such a short time., Had it for about 8 months now.<br />Sent quickly with nice packing.  Comes with generic manual that covers watches with more/less features.<br /><br />The watch itself is great.  Band is comfortable.  Leather and stitching is great quality, no flaws on mine.  The internal parts are all nice and shiny, no smudges left over from manufacturing.  Couldn't be happier with the black on gold look.  Very reflective golden look.<br /><br />A single 'charge' or wind-up will make my watch last just under 24 hours sitting there.  While on wrist moving around, it is about 1.5 days? before I need to wind again.  I've been adventurous with the watch and no failures yet.  Nor has the glass been scratched yet or the black bezel started flaking of scratching...suggesting this is very well made.  I keep thinking one day this has to start getting beat up...I don't go easy with it on.  But somehow it's still fine.<br /><br />Con (4 star):  The time is a bit fast.  After about 12 hours, it's about 2-3min ahead.  After a day, it's about 5min ahead.  However, the control knob to reset time is a simple twist of the dial and done., I purchased this watch when it was listed as either deal of the day or lightning deal on Amazon. While I can't remember the specific type of sale, it was a good price so I ordered without hesitation. I was looking for a watch with a timer feature. This watch can be set to any time you wish on the timer. I prefer this to some similar watches that have preset times you must choose from. This lights up at the push of a button.  This is also a nice feature.  My only negative is that the strap has turned blue. I suspect this is from resting my arm on my jeans while sitting. Aside from the start discoloration, the features of the watch are quite nice and the watch appears to be well made., I bought this watch at least a year ago.  Lost it.  Moved furniture.  Still lost.  Threw a load of wash into the dryer.  Something clanking.  Sure enough,  this poor little watch was in a pocket...took it out and it was keeping perfect time.  JUST TICKING AWAY.  I found it four days ago.  Still ticking., This product was terrible, and Amazon is terrible for selling it. The watch stopped working the same day and it does not complete all the functions listed in the product details. JUST TERRIBLE, I want my money back., Suitable for my child in eight years old .. Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, Nice looking watch. Only worked for a year and now cannot get any help with a return. A warranty is only as good as the people behind it., I love this watch! I always get people asking me where I got it, for the price it's great, easy to read (although difficult sometimes to read outside in bright sunshine). I will probably buy one in gold soon. Happy with it!, Like it, Beautifully made, really classy watch., The price and color were what attracted me... $20 for a digital watch from a brand that has been around for awhile. The watch band is decently thin and the face is nice and large making the wear comfortable and the time an easy read. The setup was really easy, I just followed the instructions that came with the watch. I have been using it when I coach youth soccer for the past week and am thoroughly happy with the product, circling back to the price i feel like I've already gotten the value out of it!, Ok, Two days after received the watch it's behind 15 minutes every 24 hours, The interior links scratches. The outside gold links scratches. Returned for refund.very disappointed., Watch worked awesome for about 3 months, then the strap broke., This watch is a little gem for the price. I bought this watch as an 'activities' watch. I took it to the beach thinking that if it broke, oh well. For $15, what can you expect. I also use this watch when I golf. I don't even notice it's there. For the price this watch is definitely worth it., Not perfect. It sometimes works, sometimes not, I am very happy with this purchase!!!!, VERY nice looking, classic style watch... I could not believe the price on this, well worth adding to my collection!, Everything seemed, like this is what I was expecting. After a couple of days trying I sent it back. The hands are hard to see in dark.It does have led light, but probably that was turning point. I was not sure if I need all of the stuff that this watch can do, but I was sure that I want to see the time in the dark without pushing any buttons. It's a great watch, but not for me., Bought these for my sons aged 8 & 10. They love the large orange face with digital numbers. My kids didn't even bother to read the instructions and were able to figure out how to set the watch and work its basic functions. They've had these for 6+ months with no problems (although we have not worn these in water)., We purchased this watch for my 10 year old son for his birthday. He loves this watch. It is very easy to use, and operate for his age. The velcro strap is wonderful, and makes it very easy for my son to take it on and off by himself. He wore his watch to the pool the first day he received it and it works great., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., recommended !!! excellent !!, Fun watch, I received this beauty as a gift last Christmas. I really love this watch. The power reserve is nowhere near as good as my Orient Blue Mako, but that doesn't really matter to me too much. The movement is much smoother and is hacking (which means squat to me because I don't exact second set my watches. You get a novel day and date display, neat exhibition case back and a solid weight/build timepiece. Personally, I lust after an Omega. However, I need to eat, so my watch collection is sub $1,000 right now. So, this and my Orient fit that bill. I am satisfied. You can't go wrong but be prepared for repeated Cameron meetings, etc., Like the size, Love the two tone color, and crystals. Nice Watch  Thank You, Granddaughter likes it., the worst purchase I have ever made, product as expected, delivered on time, My husband is enjoying his new sports watch!, It's for Xmas pressie!, Nice water resistant sports watch. It is a little bigger than my dressier watch, but not by much. The clear color goes with anything. I wear it when doing outside work. I like not having to worry about it getting wet. Cleans off easy too.  If I am working in the garden long, the band can get kind of slick, making it a little hard to undo, but this isn't a huge problem, as I can simply rinse and dry the watch off.<br /><br />I use the timer as well. With four kids I always have to remember to do something., Deficiently not RED!, I read a lot of reviews on various cheap winders.  If you're trying to stay under a few hundred dollars for a single unit this is the best choice.  The plastic case looks better in photos but it does the job and the various settings are required for different watches.  The LCD display and the buttons are much better quality than I expected.  The watch holster is also a very clever design and is spring loaded to put tension on most sized watches.  I have an 8.25 inch wrist and this holds my watches in place nicely.<br /><br />REGARDING THE CLUNKING - It's b.s. The clunking only happens when I put in my Rolex Deep Sea.  This thing weighs 230 grams or more depending on the links and diver extension installed.  And the carriage that holds the watch cannot be made to fit into it's cup with laser precision or otherwise you would be there all day trying to align the parts.  There has to be a mm or two of free play so you can slide in the carriage with ease.  When I removed this watch and put on my ceramic Submariner, which is about 175 grams, the clunking noise was 98% gone.  And when I put on my Milgauss, which is 160 grams, it's totally silent.<br /><br />Almost all watches, even massive 44mm swiss watches, don't weigh as much as Rolex, so as long as you're under 150 grams, which is still very very substantial, this little box operates beautifully.  None of my pieces are overwound and I don't have to keep setting the time and date and wearing out my crown, stem, pinion, gaskets, etc which will cost me a heck of a lot more to replace than these winders will.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I say do it.  These are on eBay for $67 and up.  This is a great price with free shipping., this watch when worn receives lots of attention, Impressive quality and precision case plus outstanding timekeeping right out of the box, use it everyday!, Excellent, Great size for my 10 year old's wrist. He wanted a watch like his dads with the sports bells and whistles. This fit the bill perfectly.  Would also work well on a small woman's wrist., it was damaged when i receive it !!!!, I got it, What more do you want, I gave it to my bitch on the side she like it hope my wife don't find out!!!, Very small, Cool looking watch and it fits my tiny thin wrist!  Love that it has indiglo too.  Packaging looked a bit damaged, but all paperwork was there and the watch was fine, so I don't really care, it wasn't a gift.  Wrist band is best for small wrists., Nice looking watch.  Has worked well.  Keeps accurate time., Thank you my boyfriend loves it. Exactly how i expected. And its arrived even sooner., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., The white numbers on the pink border rubbed off on the first day my daughter wore it.  She was excited to learn how to use the numbers to tell time, but the numbers aren't there and she is disappointed.  Rip off., Beautiful watch, a head turner!, A little bit small for someone with bigger hands/wrists but a very classy looking watch., Alright, This is my &#34;girlfriend&#34; watch.  Big, full featured, and does a lot of things if you know what buttons to push.  Maybe a little wierd., Excellent, It was alright the first week but it stopped working after 2 weeks of use worst watch ever I would spend my money on a apple watch, Awesome watch, the compass, barometer, & battery saver option make this watch a new favorite of mine. Highly recommend., The delivery was on time, but the Watch were stopped. I really hope it's not broken, I hope that it's just a matter of dead battery., Feels good but it looks like a small watch on my wrist... I have another 40mm watch with a leather strap and it looks very appropriate because it has a narrow bezel, this watch has a wide bezel that I'm not too fond of., too bad， not even working. Anybody tell me how can I return it!!!!, Excellent product and fast delivery!, Just got my watch today - it's gorgeous!  I love that this is a 3-hand watch and it is so dainty and beautiful looking.  It doesn't look very expensive, but I wanted an every day watch so that I can keep my other watches for special occasions., So far holding up well.  I haven't had the problem of the white color wearing off and it still is in pretty good shape in the several months I've had it., This watch has a Japan movement not a Swiss one, it's either fake or I was ripped off ... Watch looks good but too light to be original., Boy this watch is cheaply made, but for the price what do you expect?, This is the 3rd Relic watch I've bought (over several years.)  I love the design and the quality.  My only complaint with this watch is that occasionally the latch comes undone, but not really a big deal.  I would buy this again., Exellent, An elegant watch that really stands out. It's big, but not too big. I really like the look with business casual but it is versatile enough to wear as a casual watch or dressing up. I am very pleased with the purchase. Other reviewers are correct, something about the strap makes it sit on the wrist funny. It always seems like the dial is tilting away from you when you want to read the time., Really outstanding winder having no issues with the product, Sturdy and heavy watch that resembles a Rolex at a fraction of the price. Comes with a mini-diver hard case box., I've had this watch for a couple of days now and I haven't found anything to complain about.  The band is highly adjustable for any size wrist and it feels natural.  The clock was easy to set and all of the sensors seem to be working well.  The display is easily readable from pretty much any angle., Even though it's a men's watch I bought it for my girl since she likes big watches like myself and she loves it. And for the price I couldn't pass it up., Just what i wanted., Great looking watch with a large face. Has good weight on it. Looks like a very expensive watch. I get many complements when I wear it. You will love it!, excelente, Cute and dainty.  I got one for my 4-year granddaughter also, because she liked it., Watch the mail is poor, Excellent, I really like this watch. I love everything about it. I was surprised when I accidentally hit the watch against a metal corner and it suffered no damage, it's very resistant. I think the digital watch display could be a little bigger, but I'm okay with it., I bought two!  I have  7 and 9 year old granddaughters. It runs really large,.... perhaps for an adult size wrist. I'll have to take it to a jeweler to get it sized. But, it's a quality watch., Beautiful watch. Sits nicely on my wrist and looks gorgeous! Would recommend to anyone., Beautiful watch!!!, cheap looking, It's beautiful. works well,  with a charged battery!, This is the fourth watch winder box combination I've purchased through Amazon and they have all met or exceeded my expectations for quality and value., Happy with product, inexpensive and works well., This watch is just as pretty in person as it is in the picture. I bought this for my daughter, she loves butterflies. This is a sturdy light weight watch. It works well, and is great for everyday use. Highly recommend., It's ok. Picture looks better., This watch was purchased for my mother-in-law who LOVES butterflies! Due to it not being Amazon Prime eligible it did take a couple weeks to receive. However it was well worth the wait. The butterflies are beautiful, my favorite is one on outside of the watch, its raised slightly and the stones are beautiful especially when the light hits it.<br />The face of the watch has great details, stones around the face in place of numbers, and beautiful detailing on the butterflies.<br />The band itself needed several links taken out in order for it to fit, which was not difficult at all. Love the fact that the size of the band makes it possible for it to fit on all sizes of wrists.<br />Nice quality watch, which is expected from the Geneva brand. I own several of their watches and will definitely purchase again!, I love this watch. I thought the face may be too large, but it's perfect and easy to read. The adjustable band allowed for a perfect fit., GreatA+++++++++, Excellent style, quality and versatility, Too small for the Swatch Irony. I recommend buying a sport band and cut notches with a Dremel Tool instead., Excelent, this supper cheap pos was an awesome gag gift, The color is off and I'm not sure but the watch isn't working., I like watches, my only choice in men's jewelry and I'm very fond of this watch!  I had watched the price on Amazon and hesitated buying it hoping it would go lower but they raised it to full retail so I did not buy.  Kept checking and one day found they had finally reduced the price so I quickly purchased it.  I really wanted an all black watch and honestly I had been looking at this Fossil for about six months.  Nicely constructed chronograph with silicone band and clear crystal.  Looks good and I'm glad I bought it!, I just don't understand why three of it will stop...if you have any answer for this please forward it to me because when i check the net i can't find the exact answer of it., It is a nice watch, it came early than expected. Its comfortable to wear, I think its neat how the hour is on top and the minutes are on the bottom. The only thing I wish it could have had was an instruction manual. I didn't know I was suppose to cut part of the strap off to fit my wrist until I had to look up a similar item just to read the reviews to see how it works. Other than that its nothing to be dissapointed of. Its water proof, tells the time and its comfortable., Seems shorter than most bands. Leather is not the quality that I expected., This watch has unusually large links so sizing is almost impossible.  Uncomfortable watch size it's either much too big or too small and can't return.  Don't spend your money on this watch!, It seems a little cheap and I'm having difficulty with adjusting the time, but it's a nice watch all the same. It's good for 5 bucks, especially!! As far as accuracy to the anime goes, it's great! I love it. Let us see how durability treats it, though. I'm going to go easy on the chain and I'd suggest you do the same., I really like this watch, once I hit 40 my eyes started getting bad and this watch is easy to read, it does not have all the bells and whistle of more expensive watches but for me I like a nice simple watch that is easy to read and looks good, and you can't beat the price.<br />I would not hesitate to order this again,, This was my grooms gift to my husband. It's beautiful but the battery dies every 6 months., Purchased for my wife, she says it's very pretty and works well. I agree it's a very nice looking watch perfect for small wrist women. Amazon took a full week just to ship it, can't imagine how they could provide a reasonable excuse for that., I love this watch it is even better looking than the picture and so far it keeps perfect time.  This watch runs very small as other reviews have stated which is why I purchased it, I have tiny wrists (6&#34; inches) so it fits me perfect.  There is no way to adjust the size so if your wrist is larger than 6-1/8&#34; I don't think it would fit. Update - I have had this watch for a few months and it's still keeping perfect time, When first researching this brand, I was worried because there is not a lot of history or information available on this one.  And there is a dearth of information on the various watch blogs and forums.  So I originally began looking around for a more established brand that had this same face.  To my surprise, I could not find any other watch that had these features.  Plus, at this price, I figured it was worth a shot.  So I bought it and I am pleasantly surprised with my purchase.<br /><br />I love the crystal, which has a slight dome that subtly distorts the watch face when looking at it from an angle.  But the dome is not big enough to be noticeable in any other way.  You may be able to see it in the video, but even when looking at the watch directly from the side, it's difficult to tell that it has a domed crystal.  This adds a touch of class in my opinion and I love it.<br /><br />One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was that the larger subdial at the bottom is the regular second hand for the watch (easily missed in the video if you're not looking for it).  The large second hand attached to the hour and minute hands is actually the stopwatch second hand.  So the large second hand remains stationary until you press start/stop button on the upper right.  This is another subtle feature that I love and can't find anywhere else.<br /><br />As others have said, the watch is big.  I tend to be happy with anything between 44mm and 48mm, so this one suits me just fine.  It is extra thick at 13mm, but nothing that gets in the way of regular use for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that fold over part of the clasp has a little too much play in it for my taste.  I almost feel like I could accidentally catch it on something.  It hasn't happened yet, so maybe my fear is misplaced, but I think I would feel more comfortable if it didn't have the fold over clasp for safety, and instead just used the push button clasp by itself.  I'll probably end up switching the band anyway, because compared to my Citizen, the band feels cheaper.  And I feel like I may be able to add some character to the watch with a leather or regular NATO strap.  I will edit this with pics when I do.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this watch and it will be a part of my collection for quite a long time.  And Burgmeister is now on my list of approved watches.anyway, because compared to my Citizen, the band feels cheaper.

And Burgmeister is now on my list of approved watches., excellent, Just replace it and it was easy to replace thanks., A very nice reissue of a watch they made in the 70's. The crowns don't screw down. The one for the inner bezel has a good snug feel and  the bezel stays in place. One disappointment is the lume. It's weak and doesn't last very long. Other than that it's a beauty.<br /><br />Bob, A niceaddition to my bands., Man, this watch is awesome.  Very high quality it seems.  So far its the best watch I have.  I wouldn't trade it for anything., A fun watch that I like to wear onstage . It always gets attention., Screams for attention. Solid build. Rather heavy - useful in hand to hand combat...;-)<br /><br />Has its own charm., Love love love it!  We have bought probably 5 LED alarm clocks in past year. We aren't stupid but could never get them set right.  Directions weren't clear and we resorted to alarms on phones. Finally found this &#34;old school&#34; clock and love it. Simple to use, great alarm and makes absolutely no ticking noise!  Should have bought a clock like this long time ago!  Well worth the money and with Amazon Prime it was here in 2 days!, Looks good on the wrist. Nice blue dial., This is a nice-looking, casual watch. It has an attractive leather band which seems like it will be durable. It’s easy to read when telling time since the numbers and lines are large. The day and date are also easy to see. As expected for this type of watch, it has a second hand. Also note that the watch does require a battery. Nothing fancy, but good for an everyday watch., Totally disappointed. It came broken and unraped!, Love this watch . All the functions are correct . Very nice quality for the money. I recommend this to anyone. Another nice feature is the watch band size was large enough to fit my wirst and  have it sized., Arrived earlier than Amazon predicted.  The watch is very cute.  Batteries were working upon arrival.  It's a little bigger than I expected, but I like it.  I wish there were number ticks on the watch someplace, because due to the size it's difficult to tell where the hour hand is pointing.<br /><br />I received at a discount in exchange for an honest review., Well made with no sharp edges and easy to open/close., not the tight size, Perfect fit. For casio, Very classy, purchased as the perfect gift for my brother! Absolutely loves it! Now I may need to get one for me!!!, So far so good! Ordered this with one day shipping at 85$ next day it's on here for 52$ so sending it back to replace my order for the better price. G shock killer? Only time will tell I sent my g shock back to order this one and glad I did, better built seems so anyways also the most comfortable watch iv owned fits very well idn why ppl rag on it being hard to read the face in low light I never have an issue and besides has a great light for night that glows the Whole screen also compass works great spot on all the time when the alarm sounds the light also flashes although when using the compass I noticed be light flickers while compass is in use idn if it a malfunction or supposed to do that but all in all for 50 bucks it well worth and would definitely buy this again great looking feeling and over all a bad a$$ watch for what u get couldn't go wrong!  UPDATED 4-5-16 Still 5 STARS this is truly a g shock killer in my option best watch by far iv owned I never take it off I'm rough on it each day and not a scratch on it never a hiccup one fits like a glock. Just bought my fiancée engagement ring from Jared as I'm waiting on it to be sized a saleman try's to sale me a 600$ citizens Eco drive watch have to say was a sweet looking watch but honestly wouldn't stand a chance taking over this bad boy so my words of advice buy this watch with out a dought u will not regret it!, My boyfriend liked it. :) It looks like in the picture., Perfect!!!, Beautiful piece of jewelry!, Okay, This must be about the lowest end of Wenger watches, but given that, it seems fairly sturdy and dependable.  Not exactly what I was expecting, but for the price I kept it for my son., This is not all leather.  The inner material is some type of foam plastic that cracked within weeks.  This think will only last a few more weeks.  Can't believe that Timex would risk there Brand name with junk like this., Excellent quality, Fantastic.  I am a watch nut, buff, enthusiast, collector.  I dream watches.  The box this watch came in is fine furniture.  The watch is cosmetically as close to flawless as it gets.  I have a thick wrist and this watch band was still larger than I needed for a comfortable fit.  Fortunately it is designed for easy link removal.  This watch weighs like a feather.  It is a large watch but I believe it would still be attractive on a female.  It really weighs almost nothing.  I would be the first in line to hold hands with a woman wearing something like this.  I still remember women wearing &#34;mod watches&#34; in the late '60s - early '70s.  HUGE metal kabob looking things, to go along with their mood rings.  Well, here is your new mod watch.<br /><br />I don't want to leave the impression that this is not a masculine watch.  It is, but it would look great on anyone.  If you put this on and go out in public, expect to get hammered with questions, comments, compliments, etc.  If you'd rather have conversations about the weather, politics, sports, then put your Timex on before you step out.<br /><br />I know that the price may seem excessive for wood.  I stopped spending on watches some time back.  Other &#34;things&#34; are more important.  Initially I was concerned about the wood, and what effect normal body moisture might have on this.  Humidity and high summer temperatures are ridiculous here in Arkansas.  I know this watch will weather well.  I took it to my watch guy at our local jewelry store for his opinion.  A little old man behind a thick glass window, and an electron microscope contraption strapped to one side of his face.  He's squinting at me with his free eye.  &#34;What is this, you bring me?&#34;<br /><br />I have too many watches.  I have a four watch winder box that looks like it was manufactured by a piano company.  Russian watches, an old Omega, a really old beaten Breitling that is so heavy, I could sooner win an arm wrestling match with my left arm than my right.<br /><br />Honestly, I am not employed by any company whose product I review.  I am in no way affiliated with Woodie Specs or any other company that I post reviews for.  This is simply my personal opinion.  And if I could wear non-prescription sunglasses, I'd be wearing wooden ones, most likely from Woody Specs.  I'm almost ready to wear a broccoli tie and brussel sprout cuff links., I like the band.  Used it on my Invicta 8926.  Wasn't crazy about the ND Limits table but not a problem.  As stated in other reviews, not very flexible but overall a very good band., Very happy with the product unbelievable that can deliver for such a low price. Thank u., This is my second or third DaLuca nylon strap. They are definitely the thickest nylon straps you can buy. A bit pricey, but you'll notice a difference compared to lesser expensive straps. Only complaint, they're not soft like some others, however, they are more comfortable than an original strap. I used this one to replace the bracelet on a new Seiko Diver watch. It really lightened it up and feels more secure. Yes I recommend DaLuca's., Almost perfect. The only fault I see is that the light does not work on other modes but the home mode. You cannot turn the light on while on the alarm, timer etc. modes. I'm keeping it, can't ask for more for $39., Sweet, Nice looking for the money. but too shiney for my taste. I prefer a matte look. It keeps good time and is easy to read. The bracelet is long and can be adjusted. It will fit almost any wrist. I really like the combination of gold and silver. I hope the face is scratch resistant., I bought this watch in june 2015 a couple of times wearing this watch while taking a shower and the Timex stopped ticking !....its now a piece of junk and I'am out my money., Nice box it comes in and really like the look, Nice watch but noticed that would begin breaking after only one month the crown broke after two Days, now two screws in b the band are loose and the winder piece is gone.  overpaid, even with the discount, You can not go wrong with a Swatch watch.... and horses!, For all dog lovers!  These make Fantastic gifts!  Works well and it's just Fun!, This watch is so pretty!, date is kind of small even with the magnified glass bump, had hard time to chagne the date too. but to tell time it's great. and it's waterproof!, Very user friendly watch. Large digits are easy to read while training. Only wish it had an average pace on the data save mode.,, Looks so expensive. It runs like a charm!, Geat looking watch. Wife loves it. I got a compliment the very first time I wore it to a meeting., The only complaint that I have with this watch is that the weight may take a little bit of time to get used to if you are not familiar with wearing a heavier watch.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend Men's World Timer Collection Stainless Steel Watch arrived at our home in a cushioned box with a protective sleeve that immediately had you thinking that this was a quality product inside.  If a company is going to spend so much on the packaging then the watch inside must be a show stopper.  We were NOT disappointed in this watch.  Remove the sleeve and open the box and you have a stainless steel watch nestled in a soft black velvet fabric.  The watch is covered with a protective film that needs to be removed.  The watch has a five year warranty that you simply have to register your investment and you'll have additional protection if something happens to your watch.  The watch is comfortable to wear but be aware that it weighs 16 oz.<br /><br />This watch is a show stopper!  It has:<br /><br />Swiss Quartz movement<br />Water resistant up to 330 feet<br />Sapphire- coated mineral crystal<br />Polished black ion-plated stainless steel case and band<br />Chronograph functions: 60 seconds, 30 minutes, and 1/10 of a second subdials with date function<br />and more!<br /><br />Instruction book included, It works fine so far (but that's no proof of anything.) But the band is kind of shoddy. There's a leather strip over the holes that already has it's blue surface scraped away. That's really only visible to me mostly, though, so I'm not that upset., exellent, I bought this watch while living in Hawaii right after becoming a mom, I wear it in the ocean, during kids' bathtimes, in the pool, and while I'm sleeping (so when kids wake up in the middle of the night I can find out the time without shining a bright phone light). I have worn it almost constantly for over 3 years, only taking it off to shower and when really dressing up. I wear it to church and out all the time. I am just now going to have to replace the battery for the first time. This watch was on sale when I got it for $19 and has been one of my favorite purchases. I would pay much more for it again., It looks really cool. It's going to buy it for my brother., Watch band functions well.  I had to replace the pin holding the clasp to the band soon after I got this because it broke off.  The pin is actually a little bit too big for the clasp so have to bend the clasp a bit to get it in but I did manage to do it.  Been working fine for a month or so now., Great watch for a smaller wrist. I have looked a long time for a watch that would fit me will. I finally found this watch. It is super easy to read and very comfortable on my small wrist. I use it every day and love it., cheap looking, Fantastic watch for workouts and &#34;mom on the go&#34;.  Exactly what I needed!, Excellent light weight watch. Great button feature that quickly changes from 12h to 24h., It looked like the picture but felt somewhat flimsy and cheap when I put it on.  Although I got it for a deal, I ended up sending it back., Bought this for my wife (13th Anniversary).  Priced cheaper than Zappos and Macy's, this was a no brainer.  Product was just as advertised, except that it looks way better in person.  Very classy watch for a classy lady., perfect, I bought it as a gift for my mom and she likes it a lot. Very pretty design and looks just like picture, I have hd this watch for a year now and it decided to stop working on my. But I'm not one to be afraid of tinkering so I just removed the back and replaced the batteries. There are two batteries (maxwell is stock) I bought Duracell 377 for the smaller battery and c1220 for the larger battery. It works like a charm again. I love this small watch because it does not get in the way during clinical rotations as a nurse. I can pull it up and clean my hands thoroughly without worrying about it being in the way. I also like the light for evening shifts, I can see the time perfectly. It was worth changing the batteries., The watch in an all black color with dark numbers and dark dials Hard to see time, Battery was dead on arrival., It works for me, Great looking watch that is easy to read, set, and get to all the functions. But after a 30min swim in a 6ft pool the watch died. The notes on this watch says water resistance is rated to 100ft but my watch is now dead. Would have given it 5 stars if it didn't get water logged and died., To big and bulky for a small arm. RETURNED, Love Seiko alarm clocks, The clock is great as the past Braun alarms have been but the door has fallen away from its pins.  We are very careful with it and have never dropped it or abused it but the tiny pin that is lodged into the housing of the clock pulled away because the plastic area where the pins are attached failed and the small hole that holds one of the pins is now a slot so the pin slips out and the door falls off.  I will not buy this product again due to the defect in manufacturing.  There must be a better way to keep the door on the clock., I really enjoy this rose gold hardware watch. It has a clean classic look of a watch and it doesn't break the bank. I was a little unhappy with the leather strap at first because of all the cracking, but it's not noticeable because there's no peeling coat on the leather., Had to get two links taken out to get it to fit right, but it's perfect, be aware that the pins split once they are pushed out of the links, the CAN be pushed back in, just don't lose them if you are DYIng. A nice balance between masculine and feminine. It both goes well with silver jewelry as a &#34;wear-out&#34; piece and as something you can wear with a business outfit. Comes in a very nice box. The lack of any tick marks by which to read the time can be a drawback, but to me this is more of a jewelry piece than a watch that I rely on for exact time measurement. Fits solidly on the wrist., Best travel watch!, Better than I thought. I usually wear Velcro watch straps, but this one is as good, if not better., High quality very beautiful, For the price, loses 1 minute every week., Another nice Seiko 5. Made in Malaysia (NOT CHINA OR KOREA!). Much nicer in person. The dial is more of a medium dark beige than the photo shows. The strap is just plain ugly. It's not cheap, the color is just awful. Swap it out for a NATO/Zulu or a nice leather and it's much more appealing. Out of the box, one little shake was all it took to start it up. I've come to prefer my Seiko 5's (7s26 & 7s36 movements) over my more expensive watches. I think it's because of their simplicity and reliability. Twice a day I take the time to shake each of my Seiko's for 40-60 seconds, and they've never stopped running. Accuracy? Just fine right out of the box, no break in or &#34;setting in&#34; time needed for them. To a potential buyer: if you don't know anything about these automatics, research them before buying so you understand how they work. Otherwise, you'll end up thinking you bought a watch that is defective. Simply put; these are great watches at ridiculously low prices. You'll learn they run for years with no maintenance.  I own both the SNK's and SNZG's. If you think the SNK's might be a bit small for you, check out the SNZG's. They're larger, but have a similar look. Both are nice military style watches. Watch came in a blue Seiko box with white leather-like pillow, original owners manual, and Seiko warranty card., Came with one wrong pin. I bought this as a backup up to an earlier one. Pins very brittle. Quality varies greatly. The first was one was very durable. Luck of the draw on this one., It's a cool looking watch but i had for two weeks and the battery died so i went and bought a package of batteries for it and it didn't work, This is a beautiful timepiece. I haven't had it very long but so far I love it. The feel is solid, the look is clean and the price is right for a high quality Swiss watch. I know there is a lot of debate about the wisdom of buying luxury watches on line in the grey market rather than through authorized dealers but given the great experiences I've had with Amazon in the past and the fact I'm saving $1,300 I'm at ease with the trade-off., Beautiful and practical. I love it. Maybe the instructions for set the hour is confuse, but not impossible., I've only had for 1 week but so far I love it.  It is easy to read and comfortable.  Love the strap.  I have small wrists and it doesn't slide.  The color is much better live than on the internet., This is a beautiful watch! I've bought two as gifts, but wish I had one for myself!, Very comfortable, Doing the job so far, very stylish waterproof and shockproof, I have one for work in construction and another for the party. I recommend it 100%, Item tarnished.... returning, I order 3 of these watches. they look really cheap. really really cheap., Awesome. I used to have the larger 46mm small second full titanium but sold it because titanium scratches sooooo easy. This one is awesome. Be warned screwa are loctited in so bring it to a jeweler who knows what theyre doing. Absolutly geoorgeous timepiece. Its my daily wearer. Highly recommend it. Pics do it no justice. Ceramic bezel insert is stunning..., I like the watch a lot. It looks great and is a replica of a the Rolex SUBMARINER GREEN DIAL. The watch wears fairly light and easily will get you some compliments. My only flaw with the watch is that it is not 100% water proof and that is why it gets 4 out of 5 stars., best smart watch I ever come across. worth the money., LOL &#34;Adventurously designed&#34;? Jesus Christ this thing is ugly., I LOVE MY WATCH! AWESOME FIT AND THE PACKAGING WAS AWESOME!, the clock has a spot on the board. Please attention testify against product quality., I ordered 3. 1 didnt work, One of my most faithful watches. I take it to work with me every single day and it never gets damaged or barely gets any dirt or anything on it at all. Very truthfully, worth the money for this Bulova., Works great. Nice look and finish. Accurate and easy to read. The button at 2 o'clock will change the day of the week and cannot be locked. Sometimes the day gets changed unintentionally. I still rated this 5 star as I think that is a small problem. One quick glance and I get the right time. Still my favorite of my 14 watch collection., Compared to my other Invicta watches, the display itself is too small for my liking., the watch is ok but like a lot of other people has commented it is extreamly dark and if you are a bigger guy like myself it's going to be a tight fit, Yet another addition to my collection of Invicta watches. all are exactly what I want in a watch without the high prices. Several of my Invictas I have had for several years. Still work perfectly., so cool, exellent, This was a disaster from the time I opened the package. First, the molded plastic container was broken. Second, the battery was dead! To make matters worse, where it's to be opened broke while I was holding it. NEVER AGAIN!<br /><br />Edited: Sept 6...  I'm still puzzled at the thought of receiving such a SUB STANDARD product. This has never happened before regardless of what item I'd ordered. Truly, the poor quality control of receiving this watch (if you could really call it that) in such horrid condition, indeed,was a shocker. It was beyond disappointing., Quite small. Was really disappointed. I haven't used it., Beautiful watch however the gold tone metal is wearing off. Figured it would wear with time, but watch is only 2 months old., It fits nicely and looks good but three of the holes have broken since I got it and I've had it less than a month., I got in a bike (as in bikecycle) crash on the way to work and my wrist scraped across the road surface.  I was wearing this watch, though, and it took all the damage like a pro and, thankfully, much of my arm remained road-rash free.  The watch got scratched up, but continues to work fine.  Two months after that I went SCUBA diving in Pensacola with this watch.  Went as deep as 110 ft and the watch held up just fine, despite the damage its accumulated from my bike crashes and general wear and tear., It's beautiful, Don't fit on Motorola Moto 360, but I adapted for this watch, Beautiful watch.  Fits well.  One of the few watch brands that considers that some of us have very small wrists. Many other brands can end up either halfway up the arm or over the hand, making any type of activity difficult.  Thanks to Caravelle New York and Amazon for carrying these hard-to-find watches, particularly at reasonable prices., Brand new fresh battery.  Rated at 1.55V.  I received and tested at 1.58V., I love it I wish they also have white with this model, Casio's women's watches in this series and the Futurist series cannot be beat. They are small but easily read, keep perfect time,  have fantastic colors, and I so far have 4 of them, so you know how much I like them!, I love it, Well worth the money that was spent.  I can get two days with out of it without charging., The electronics in the watch for what ever reason started to constantly beep every twenty minutes for No reason.....what up with Timex  quality control !l, Excellent, This is a kinetic watch. They are discontinued by Seiko. So this is a very old Kinetic watch. It doesn't work and chances are none of this version of the watch will work. There is a capacitor inside which is charged by motion. If it has sat for over a year and not been worn that capacitor discharges and cannot be recharged. I know I have had two of these watches in the past which no longer work.<br /><br />It's going to cost me $75 plus tax to get repaired by a local jeweler. I suggest of you choose to buy this watch you will need to do the same. I didn't return the watch because I wanted it and the Jeweler assured me after the repair it will be as good as new. The original price on this watch was almost $500 so it was worth fixing., Great watch!!! The black and blue looks awesome together. Very eye catching. Many people mistake it for a G Shock because of its shape and size. For $22 you cant beat the price. I wear it to my work at a Hospital ED, lift weights, swim, run, and wear it out on the town. The band is thick and durable as well. They sell the same watch at JC Penny for $34. Buy it from Amazon!!!, Exactly what I wanted!, I returned it was to complicated to set and you had to add number to get date and time! Not for a child at all, unless you have an advanced one#, Love it! Looks very nice. Good features., ThIs watch may look really nice but it most definitely not a $465 price tag quality like it says upon delivery.  Got this during prime day for $48 and I even feel now that might have been to much. The band that you wear on your wrist is cheap rubber material that actually snapped in half in a month after buying it during regular use (actually while I was asleep) just be cautious on what you &#34;think your saving&#34; when the the sale price is exactly what it's worth, bad, Okay, After losing my very nice daily driver I was skeptical to spend so little a watch after having grown acustom to a fancier one, but this is a solid timepiece. The quality of the strap is exceptional for the price and the watch itself it attractive and of an appropriate weight.<br />This is such an awesome way to class up an outfit for under $30.<br /><br />Great buy. Would highly recommend!, DOA!!!, Smaller watch then I  thought. I found better watches at a better price. It is a little cheap looking but does the job.  Very few  extra functions, but  band is comfortable.  (it's okay...), Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, I was happy with the way it looked, but the unfortunately band and loops seem to be cracking after only a few months and will need to be replaced with something else soon., The watch was as described and depicted. It is a little on the large side.  An elegant, reasonably priced timepiece with a little historical German flair., I am really hard on watch bands, I have been through 4 in two and a half years with my current watch.  So far this one is holding up really well, exellent, Always wanted one of these until I received a Casio Wave Ceptor as a gift 10 or more years ago.  While the Wave Ceptor is a nice watch (I still like it) it's a digital/analog that has radio-controlled timekeeping and is somewhat complicated to operate...but it still works great, though.  I feared that this one would be difficult as well.  However, I quickly realized it is very simple to use.  I'm very pleased with the size, shape, operation, and features, etc.,etc..  You can't really go wrong with this model...or any other Casio in my experience., I love this watch and so does my boyfriend. It came in a MK box with booklet and had a price tag stuck to the back which was partially scrapped off. Another price tag is strung to the watch as well. It is an authentic product and I am very happy with my purchase., This thing is a beast!  I have it on a Suunto Core. The other reviews that say stuff about durability are crazy!  I'm in the military and am frequently out in &#34;the field&#34; and wear this every time.  Sweat, sun, HEAT, wear, dust, etc. nothing stops this thing, and it still looks fantastic wearing out to dinner with my wife., Swiss Legend watches are just beautiful, durable time pieces and this one is no exception! I especially like that I could remove the links with a small screwdriver myself and didn't need to take it to a jeweler., I bought these to make some static wrist straps as the elastic bands at work were quite old and losing elasticity. So far they've held up quite well, but are somewhat scratchy at times., I love it! I bought the gold first and liked it so much I bought the silver. I've received several compliments. My husband at first said it was ugly and now he think it looks cute. It looks retro cool and can be dressed up or down. So glad I got them!!!!, Watch is as attractive as advertised. It keeps perfect time and I have received numerous compliments on the look and style.<br />I would not hesitate to buy again if necessary., awesome, I bougth this watch but it come with the watch crown broken, Returned it the same day, UPDATE<br />I am taking a moment to edit my original review. I did give the item 5 stars at the beginning, however I have dropped my rating to a 2, the reason for this is the third time I wore the watch/bracelet combo, the bracelet strap snapped in half on me. Judging by appearance this item appeared to be made of good quality material, appearance isn't everything unfortunately, the quality is just not there on this item.<br /><br />Original Review<br />Perfect watch to pair with a nice pair of jeans and boots! Nice leather band easy to fasten. Button enclosures, fastens with two buttons one on the band and one on the bracelet band. The bands are attached but do snap closed separately. Does have two options of buttons so you can get the best fit possible for you wrist size.<br />Nice quality, rustic looking with nice detail., Beautiful timepiece., Bought it as a gift for my brother since he loves Deadpool<br />And he is very happy with it<br />Thank you for cooperating with my delivery, Worst thing you can buy on Amazon! Feels cheap is cheap!, Amazing watch. Fits perfectly on wrist and the clock part itself isn't too big nor is it too small. It looks sick and adds to your style., Just what I needed<br />Nice, compact and has all the tools needed!!!, Excellent watch, I fully recommend it!, I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review. I am beyond disappointed in this watch. One I open it excited and it blue, royal blue not purple at all. Looks nothing like the picture not only that it's ex cheap material and would not fit on my wrist this looks like it it could fasten around my neck?!?!?! Yea that big around the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the watch does in fact work which I will be taking the watch and attaching it to a band that actually fits around my wrist. But highly Do Not recommend this product unless you want It have a watch on your neck., Screen broke and I couldn't repair. Repair cost was more expensive than the watch itself, This was a gift for my 13 year old son and I never noticed it until he pointed it out yesterday.  The watch face is completely off center.  If I'd know I would have returned it but now it's past the cutoff.  He said he thought it was fine before but we can't tell how it could have turned....and can't get it to move now.  He is dyslexic so I could see him missing it in the beginning?<br /><br />The watch is pretty heavy but my son likes it that way and the color is his favorite.  Wish I could give it more stars but the face being off is a deal breaker!!!, This watch is my first 'swiss made' ETA valjoux 7750 automatic movement watch. 7750 movement has a long history behind it and is well known for its good power reserve, precise time keeping and reliability that could last a lifetime. Compared to other brands that has watches with 7750 movements like Hamilton and tissot which falls around victorinox 241620's price range, come with a 'day display'. But in my opinion watches other than digital watches, may not need a day display and date display is sufficient at analog ones like the one we have here at victorinox model. This 241620 model was launched in 2013 and the looks of this one is awesome. It derives inspiration from swiss army air force and has the same logo on the bracelet clasp. Military time is printed as well on the face of the dial. The look of the watch on the wrist is beautiful and the dial is just about the right size 42mm. The dark grey dial looks stunning in contrast to the silver bracelet. The chronograph function is just as a default 7750 movement's one - a12 hour counter, a 30 minute counter and a 60 seconds counter. The watch is a little heavy at around 200+ grams but you cannot help it as all the watches with 7750 movements are around this weight but on the wrist you don't really feel it heavier. I would recommend this watch to anyone, who would love to own a swiss made watch with an automatic chronograph movement that has this legendary movement - 7750 (stood the test of time - during quartz crisis) combined with the stunning aviation line up from victorinox. Go grab yours before the ones sold and shipped from amazon.com, at great discount, gets out of stock., I gave this watch to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day about 2 years ago and he absolutely loves it, this watch is truly what it claims to be, such an elegant accessory for any man., VERY NICE AND SLIM LOOKS VERY CLASSY. MY SON LOVES IT.  ONE LITTLE PROB IT SEEMS TO LOOSE 2 MINS IN TIME PER WEEK ON AVERAGE. BUT FOR THE PRICE OF A SWISS MADE WATCH STILL AN EXCELLENT CHOICE., About 1&#34; too long for my adult small to medium size wrist but still very usable: when worn on the wrist, the &#34;tongue&#34; sticks out a bit which I doubt will be a problem. It's comfortable. Thinner than the original Casio resin band which broke in 2 places after a few years full time use. Can't complain b/o price below $10. Easy to place on watch using the existing pins and a small penknife blade. Tip: remove and replace pin with the back side of the watch facing you b/o more clearance., This is a durable classy looking watch. The chrome edging on the face looks awesome and accents the red very well. It is my most accurate watch and I use it for work and in the gym. It has come in handy many times. I work in an Emergency Department and knowing what the exact time is can be very important when documenting., Perfect watch!, the strings on the sides are always coming off and always having to cut them off, Watch quit working. Only keeps digital time., Watch is junk I sent it Back, IT,s a TIMEX Nothing else needs to be said except:<br /> IT KEEPS ON TICKING ,  Those That Do not Know the Saying ,, Oh well, The way this watch was photographed I didn't see the circle of crystals surrounding the dial (they are really bright). Purchased this for my son. The flashing lights are amazing and multi-colored (and they don't blink constantly). The quality of the watch is fine, but it is clearly for a female even though masculine in style. For the price it was a great deal and the proprietor is most anxious to please the customer. Would have given a 5 star review for quality and customer service had it not been for that detail. A very handsome and useful watch otherwise. I probably didn't read the details in my haste to purchase it at a bargain price. Would be an excellent purchase for a girl/woman who likes to bike/walk/run after dusk. I'd use it myself but my son likes to play with the flashing light feature., Just okay, Excellent, It seems like a bad finishing work, I honestly think this is cool giving the fact it is super sophisticated and looks a bit antique and after getting it I didn't expect it would be small, this is my first pocket watch so I don't mind. Still it looks in ship shape condition, I just got it and I like it., Absolutely love this watch.  I've been looking for a casual watch for awhile and this is perfect.  It's fun colors and bold face really stand out.  And the large face and numbers make it easy to read, even without glasses!, I've always enjoyed the Gshock watches, but have been disappointed with the straps.  They always seem to be too long.  And shorter replacement straps or strap adapters are impossible to find.  This stainless steel bracelet is easy to adjust for a perfect fit, and, as a result, I wear it much more often., Beautiful and smaller than I think it was. Perfect for smaller wrist., Really easy to set  use, and is soooomcool to look at.  G, The strap hurts their wrist., I bought this for Steinhart ocean 2 and absolutely love it. The rubber is high quality. It's a little more still than I anticipated, but that's okay. It will break in., Excellent for the money, Mt niece likes it, As you know, this is the second watch I have ordered. I am well pleased with it. It keeps accurate time. It is very dainty and<br />the intricate work is beautiful. I had a friend at our senior center that liked it so much, I decided to order one for her. It is a<br />necklace that I am proud to wear and I have received many compliments on it. Thank You., This watch is impossible to set!  It is NOT user friendly at all and the directions that come w/ it want you to look up the instructions online but the website that they give you to find the directions to set the time and date are not even for this watch!  One more reason for me to hate Adidas!, Works as described by seller and manufacturer. Bluetooth synchronization with Casio+ App was relativily easy. On the other hand, synchronization with third party fitness apps was a little cumbersome...In general everything is working as described and simplifies my workouts since all important data is represented in the watch without having to look at my iPhone located at my armband...It also enables me to play, pause or skip my music tracks directly from my watch..., my son wore it one day and washed his hands and the paper came off and the screen went blank.The seller was great though, refunded my money immediately.. so I bought my 4 year old a &#34; big boy black water resistant watch!, Quality Purchase, Worked for about a week. Then stopp watch function mis worked- the second hand does not reset to zero and neither does the minute hand.<br />Otherwise ok ?, Excellent watch. Wonderful little bit of 80s nostalgia that's also as imminently practical today as it was when these watches were all the rage. This is Casio's best plastic band and will fit a fairly large wrist. The face is easier to read than many of the classic models. The indiglow would be nice, but the corner light works fine and is much easier on batteries. Very fond of the  Casio chime on the hour.  Programming is easy and intuitive. If you are looking for a practical watch with a bit of Reagan era flair, you won't be disappointed., Looks and feels nice, but starting to wear out very quickly at the fastening point., This is my first watch purchase in years. For the price, I think it is very comfortable & handsome. My one wish was that there was a date display on this watch, but it's not a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />COLOR: The picture is pretty true to how the color looks in person. I don't think the &#34;rose gold tone&#34; looks brassy or cheap (if anything it is not quite 'pink' enough for my taste). But it matches just fine with my other rose gold jewelry. I do wish Fossil had the rose gold metal color option for ALL of the leather colors... but alas.<br />SIZE: I have a small-medium sized wrist, and I am currently wearing it on the 2nd-to-last hole... so the extra band is a bit long. But it has one of those extra loops to hold the extra band. People with small wrists would probably be out of luck. The face is about as big as I would want. The hands are very easy to read.<br />BAND: The leather band is very soft but sturdy, and I really appreciate the comfort of having the leather backing behind the watch face -- it's never too cold, or tugging on your arm hairs!!<br />QUALITY: I have only had the watch for about a week, but the quality of the watch, the leather band, and all the fastenings seems very good to me. The clasp does not come undone during the day., I bought this for my 13 year old nephew. i just received it. It looks very strong and well made. the sieze is perfect. I use to be a Timex rep so are know the are one of the best inexpensive watches out there. I am 99% positive that my 11 year old twin boys will this watch also., Exactly as described and just the right size.  Not too big as the other g shock's tend to be too large for my arm. Wristband is gray instead of black., interior quality poor my watch is expensive and I did not trust  the plastic holder, Bought this last year summer (2014) it was inexpensive (paid $15.49), had good water resistance, and had the protector bar. I tend to be a little rough with my watches so honestly the protective bar was the selling point. It has stood up to a cruise vacation, pools, showers, landscaping, washing dishes, and many beach trips. Yesterday, I dropped it from my wrist as I went to take it off, onto tile floor. The second hand works but the hour and minute hand move A LOT slower than they should. After 10 minutes pass (by checking phone) the minute hand only moved 2 minutes. The time is WAY off and I can't keep changing it. DO NOT DROP THIS WATCH. Otherwise, it's a pretty good watch for the price. My next watch will be a Casio G-Shock GD-400 and they're on sale right now for ~$70. Oh, and before I forget. The protector/bar - that little piece of metal - is $20 to replace so don't bend or damage it!, very handy, It looks elegant, Ok, Beautiful band, nice heavy leather. Could be a bit more flexible for a watch band., Excelent, This is small in the picture but its pretty darn wonderful in sight. This is a large watch but it is not big like an Ironman watch. The face is 2&#34; in diameter and a little over 1/2&#34; thick, which makes it fairly substantial but not so large as to get in the way. It is not terribly heavy either, which is one minor concern I had until I put it on. It looks good and feels good., Ordered two at once. Both were dead on arrival. Batteries were fine, double-checked with meter. One never started. The other started and stopped within minutes. Nothing I tried to get them to work. Makes we wonder if they are knockoffs instead of Seiko, because everything else I've ever gotten from Seiko was fine., Perfect gift for our 45th anniversary (sapphire and all)!  Love the packaging!  As others have written, the band would fit the largest wrist.  We removed 4 links, and it's just fine., Cute, simple and easy watchband. a little stiff and almost to small for little wrists, I so far have no complaints with the watch. I bought it because I needed a waterproof watch so I could wash my hands frequently at my job as a CNA. I also like that it had military times, because I'm very slow at converting the time. It so far has been comfier than I had expected. I don't think the watch face is too big like others had said, and I have small hands and wrists. I think since others had said it was big I had expected it to be huge so once I got it I didn't think it was too big. The print, however, is rather small and could be difficult to read., Very pretty. Grt value, You get what you pay for. No thrills or fancy doo dads on this... If you're looking for basic and something with a seconds hand on it then this watch is for you. I like it. Only thing that irks me is the face on it is really kinda soft.(think plastic) easily marks and dings. Other than that I recommend it, gift, It's REAL! I needed an extra link, called MK customer service, they verified serial numbers, and my link is on the way for a $4 shipping fee. A few reviews had stated they thought it was fake because there was a sticker on the back of the face. The sticker is for protection and is placed over the engraved MK serial numbers! Amazing watch for such a discounted price! I can't wait to buy some more of these for Christmas presents!, This was my first watch purchase, and I bought it pretty much 10 months ago. This watch is awesome in quality, very scratch resistant crystal (sapphire crystal) , PC carbon case (tough and light plastic). tritium which has a faint glow at night for 20+ years. This watch is still in good condition wearing it everyday, I swam, and did other exercises and no problems what so ever. The tritium is faint, but you can easily see it, I like how its not outrageously bright. I don't get much compliments on the watch but for me that wasn't my purchase for getting this watch. I bought it for durability, which this watch is quite durable. This watch also is very good at time keeping, its still only about 30 seconds off after my last adjustment several months back.<br /><br />There are however a few flaws. The GMT function does not work, so you can't keep a second time. (least for me) I followed the instruction manual and tried many attempts to adjust the time but it never worked. If you get this product, expect the second time not to work. Another flaw is the date, it always goes to up to 31. For me its not a big deal, but it may irritate some people. The last flaw is that the compass itself is not top notch. It works but don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Overall the flaws are not a big deal but its something to be aware of. This is a good watch overall if you're looking for a tough watch this is a good option to consider., Beautiful watch, Works as advertised, Bougt this watch specifically for water aerobics.  Mets my requirements.  Can read the time easily., I like it, Perfect replacement ,as the rubber bands dry out and crack, beautiful, high quality, quite and priced right.... comes with cloth to cover the box and packed nice with watch tools for simple repairs and adjustment of your watch straps... will buy another two for my other automatic watches, This is my &#34;everyday&#34; watch. It's simple yet stylish, if that makes any sense..., This is a well constructed though heavy analog watch.  It has an eloquent and classy appearance.  I'm not a big fan of analog watches, but I have to admit that there is certain appeal about this watch when you're in a suit.  The few negatives that I have are the date window is small and oddly positioned, there's no back light....the hour and minute hand do have some phosphorescence, but the hour markers do not.  I set it and monitor its time keeping in relation a clock that links to national time standard.  Any lost of time is minute that I couldn't detect it over a week plus...I like that.  All  in all...a very classy and well constructed watch., Very attractive band but the leather is not flexible enough to adjust to smaller wrists., Sleek & stylish. Quiet as advertised. Better than expected for a reasonable price., It is the original part., For the amount paid for this watch, I was very pleased. It is dressy without being gaudy., Excellent!, Impossible to read in low light., I bought this item as a gift and to my chagrin this watch stopped working within 6 weeks of purchase. I am very disappointed that not only was I fooled into buying what appeared to be an expensive and well made watch, but there was no way of getting my money back or a new watch once the return window was closed a month after purchase.<br />I work hard for my money and to lose it in this way is nothing short of theft on the part of Giftstreet.  I will never buy any products from this affiliate of Amazon and I will deter any one who may consider this company.<br />p.s. strap isn't secure, hands on watch are touching and falling over each other......., Just fine, The strap hurts their wrist., The buckle broke the first time I wrote it., The watch is nice and very goodlooking but not nearly water resistant as stated. After spending a bit over one hour in water it condensed and stayed condensed for 3 days. After that it took it no more than 2 minutes of being in water to condense again., It is so beautiful😍, Your product seems to be fine.  I ordered this hoping it could help me get a really stubborn back of a watch.  It didn't but i was only hoping.  I will keep it and use it for others., I've already worn it for a week and absolutely love it. I have small wrists and I think it still looks great! I bought a Nautica marine watch last year but had to return it because it was 5mm larger than this one. 10 year batt, 100m resist., Tide graph, moon calendar, dual time, 3 alarms, stopwatch, analog/digital, with an orange led light...the perfect watch! Extra thanks to Acacia Grove for prompt shipping and a genuine watch!, It works perfect and doesn't look cheep. I did have to make a new hole to have the band tighter  and the triangle came black not silver like it shows in the picture. Other than that I love it!, Garbage.  Broke when I tried to use it., can't go wrong for the price you pay !, The Burei BM-7003-01A is a decent and modestly priced watch with excellent timekeeping and good chronometer functions.<br /><br />The face of mine differs from the product description; the face is black, not white as shown on this page.<br /><br />This watch is not too bulky and keeps excellent time. Users with large wrists may find the stock leather band slightly too small.<br /><br />The included user guide could be *much* clearer.<br /><br />I'm not a daily watch wearer, but understand that grownups sometimes have to wear one to complete their look, especially when dressed for \\\\\"serious\\\\\" appearance. This looks just fine with business attire and is not ostentatiously bulky.<br /><br />You can spend thousands more, but this will tell you the time with precision.<br /><br />Nice watch...I sure wish the user guide had not left me in a state of confusion.<br /><br />Note: this item provided for review purposes., It was an exact match to the one that came with the watch. very strong and easy to put on. I wore the original for more than three years and it began to smell so I got this new band. They shipped two new pins for it as well. I'm very pleased., It's a nice looking, well made product - but flawed.<br />I would easily rate it 5 stars, but the holes are too small<br />to accept the Seiko &#34;fat&#34; pins. Much too small.  Some<br />lube or otherwise would make no difference in this regard.<br /><br />In its favor, Hadley Roma does provide 2 (slender) pins.  But if<br />part of the reason you bought a Seiko diver's watch was the<br />security and solidity of the heavy duty original &#34;fat&#34; pins, this watch<br />strap is not for you., This watch is a baby watch.<br />Please don't be fooled!, Bought this to replace batteries on two TAG Heuer watches ... tired of paying $30 bucks for jewelry shop to replace a $2 battery. Also bought a plastic, adjustable watch holder to make it easy to hold the watch while turning the back cover off.<br /><br />After adjusting for three slots, the cover came loose with a simple turn. Really nice to have the correct pegs for the TAG Heuer slots. Simple to tighten back on as well.<br /><br />Great little tool that paid for itself 2x on the first use., I received this watch in perfect shape. Some one must have set the time before it was sent out as it was right at 6 hours off, set for GMT time. So that to me was good news since it had been sitting for 24 hours before I picked it up, or that was just perfect luck that it was set to GMT when I opened up the package. The leather strap feels good and is made of genuine leather and I think will work for me. So, today we will say the watch is perfect in all points. If I find later this not to be true, I will update my post., I got gray cover and did not taste much, I was looking for a medical alert tag for a chain necklace. This caught my eye. After reading the reviews and figuring the size. This met my needs. I could wear it like that. Then I had a brainstorm. I wondered if it would fit on my anklet. I wear one all the time interchanging when my mood changes. Their between 2 to 5mms in diameter. I knew that the tag would fit on the smaller ones. But the 3 and 5mms ones could have a problem. When I received it. The O ring used to attach it on the anklet was small. But why not attach it on the spring or lobster clasp. Perfect; I solved the problem twofold. Any diameter of an anklet or chain could be used. Some people might not like it attached to the clasp. It works for me. If you need to wear a medic alert tag. You now have this one to use on a neck chain, bracelet or anklet. No matter what diameter. I highly recommend you think about this. Then possibly get one for your needs. The tag was delivered in 4 days. Nicely packaged. So consider it. You can't go wrong., just use 2 weeks and the clock pin is broken., I really like the colors grouped in 15 second blocks which makes it really easy to use for taking vital signs.  It also has glow in the dark second hand.  The date is a little hard to see, but the rest of the watch is a nice size.  Military time hours are very small and not the easiest to read, but if you have very young eyes, this watch would be perfect., This watch is stunning.  It looks a lot nicer in person than in the pictures.  As with any watch that has no markings, it takes a bit longer to get the time but my wide doesn't seem to mind this., Arrived much earlier than predicted from Russia. I've owned 3 Vostok watches now and this one by far is the best. Vostok fixed many of the quality control issues. Even the band, although still sub par, is much better than past incarnations of this watch. Great, reliable, affordable, unique, quality automatic watch. What more could you ask for?, This watch sucks, all the pins are loose. Its poorly made. The pins keep falling out, Perfect fit.  Made my old watch with worn band look like new., Was exactly what I was hoping for it to be, This was bought as a backup watch to stand-in for my son's Casio G-Shock while the band was being repaired.  He tried to put it on his wrist and the back fell off.  It is a press fit back and not a screw-in.  We can't fit it back in and this happened after the 30 day return period.  So we are stuck with a pretty but useless watch.  I seriously doubt that it is waterproof to 100M as advertised given the ease with which it falls apart., It looks really nice, I bought it as a birthday gift for my bf but I can't find any guarantee paper inside the box., Wow... am I impressed with this watch!  I have fancier watches of course, but I needed a watch that I did not feel guilty about to just wear and abuse.  I don't really like quartz watches at all, so when I heard about the sistem51 watch last year, it really piqued my interest.  I didn't get around to ordering one until recently though.  First impressions, it feels cheap (because it is...) but still sturdy and elegant looking.  The silicon straps are comfy and look good!  The watch face itself is simple and clean (some of their other designs can get wild though).  The automatic mechanical movement works flawlessly on the watch.  What is truly amazing is what Swatch is doing in my honest opinion though.  Luxury and quality should be made for the masses, and this product clearly is a product that is supporting that notion.  Of course, what I mean by luxury is the mechanical movement.  My only complaint might be the lack of any quality materials that is used (everything is plastic...) but that would drive up costs.  So I do understand the reason for sticking with all plastic... but honestly, I would not mind if they made a slight more sophisticated version with other materials., High quality very beautiful, Back always falls/pops off. Could lose the back piece easily. Yes, it has the rubber &#34;O&#34; ring on it., It's too shiny and looks cheap.<br />Would have been nice to have a better picture of the band., I bought this watch as a replacement for my father in law whose Timex finally gave out. I was worried about it fitting his wrist. I was very pleased that it fit quite well. He loves it. It is high quality and appears durable and perfect for what he needed., I have had three Timex Ironman watches over the past 10 years.  I continue to purchase the watch for its features.  I do a lot of interval training for running and the Ironman's 100 lap feature is great to record times for every interval.  I also travel extensively and use the 5-alarm feature as my primary alarm clock.  I also use the event timer in a non-stop loop to remind me to do a repeated task every hour when I'm busy doing a second task.  For features, I really like the Timex Ironman watch.  The one drawback occurs when the battery is discharged.  The watch seems to be ultra-sensitive when I open the watch myself and change the battery.  After replacing the battery myself, the watch will randomly short out (reset all functions including the current time).  I'm sure the water-resistant feature of the watch is also compromised after I change the battery myself.  Changing a battery shouldn't be a big deal; there is probably some simple thing that needs to be done to ensure the battery is seeded correctly when replaced., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., Very nice watch. The only thing I don't like about it is the traditional second hand (the large one) is only active for the stop watch function. I thought the small second hand above the six o'clock position was for the stop watch and it was only accurate to one second, which would have been just fine for me. But that is not the case. The small second hand is for the time. The product description lead me to believe otherwise. At time of purchase, I was unable to find a review that clarified this. Otherwise, this is a fine watch., I chose this watch because it looked similar to a Michael Kors watch I fell in love with but was far too above my budget. I love it even more now! I can depend on Timex to have a quality watch at a price I can afford. I work at a hospital so it is imperative to have Military time a glance away. The design is simple yet elegant. The band is light and easy on my wrist. This watch is perfect for me and just as pretty as Michael  Kors watch!, Wish the top was glass, like the watch, but don't ever think you will be able to use it after the sun goes down, or in low litght - no useful luminesence, and a light that gives you hope you'lk be able to read the time, but it ain't never gonna happen!, Does the job very well, Love it! As mentioned in previous reviews, if you have a large wrist the band may be too small., I llike this watch band.  I am handicapped and have limited use of my hands.  I am able to put my watch on easily with this band.  I recommend it., fair enough, I am watch click door I love the watch little bit small but I like it, i love my watch. it was a really deal for the money. it is much lighter than expected. like a feather. the bracelet design is so beautiful, looks like many chains sewn together and it is quite unique design.the adjustable bracelet made me really happy because i have really narrow wrist., I bought this to wear to work.  I work in a hospital and wanted to &#34;bling up&#34; my scrubs to give them a more feminine look.  It works.  I like the glitter and the price makes me not worry too much about loosing it.  I have a problem with the fit.  It's either too big or too small depending on the number of links I take out.  Other than that, no complaints at this time., The watch just arrived yesterday and spent some time playing with it. Love the watch. It's easy to set up and love how light it is. Also, I have very small wrists and the watch still looks great and feels very comfortable. I took off a star because all four screws are loose to the touch, that is I can turn them with my finger nail. I intend to call Amazon to get a replacement watch and will update my review then., Works for what I wanted it, Much more beautiful in real, Great watch!  Looks sharp. It comfortably sits on the wrist although it felt a bit heavy at the beginning.  Easily adjustable band; you just need a small pin, and a lite hammer.  I purchased it before going on a 3 week international business trip.  I traveled through three different time zones and the watch did the job with the easy time zone adjustment. The alarm could be a little louder.  Also, the watch does not get the radio controlled time signal at my house (Staten Island, NY).  It does get it when we stay at my in-laws up north in Pennsylvania but I'm keeping it a secret from my wife as she would probably want me to get the radio signal more often..., Very bad!!, I think this band is amazing for the price. I love everything about it. Only one problem.  The clasp was bent when I got it. I've tried to mend it myself and I got it pretty good. But the hold is shaky at best. It was packaged pretty well so I'm not sure at what point it got bent. But it will do for now., Gave this as a gift to the young men in my daughter bridal party.  They loved their gift.  And it survived Boy Scout camp !!, This is the worst watch that I have ever purchased.  Very poor quality.  It's already running slow.  The most annoying thing about it is that it ticks VERY LOUD.  You cannot place it on a nightstand or anywhere near you if you are trying to sleep., Perfect, It's the best, I have had this watch for just over a month, the battery was had a low warning when I received it.  I didnt have the time to return and wait for another one.  Now the battery is completely dead.  The batteries in even my cheapest watch last at least a year.  This is my only complaint., Just as described and cheaper than at any nearby store!, Perfect, Now I can fix my own watches wish I had this a year ago just got to learn how to use all the tools but still better not to be over charged to have the work done., Exceptional watch, Excellent watch. High quality. I love it, If you have big hands (and you are a guy) do not get it, it looks like it was made for girls., pure and simply bling - oversized, heavy, and I'm sure Flavor Fav would approve - 200 meter water resistance will test it in the water park (only costs around $50) - sapphitek face (I assume is harder than my Disney World watch face) - and it still keeps time even though I only wear it when hangin with other 50-something poseurs LOL, NICE LOOKING WATCH, BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL RED BUT WAS WAY TOO SHORT AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK., This is an original, with clean lines and perfect design., Awesome watch, mine just had a slight defect on the 9am/pm click that showed up like a piece of white plastic. I was trying to wind the dial also, but wasn't able to wind the watch. Was able to set the clock using the dial though., new and i liked, The reviews complained about setting it, but if you follow the right directions, most should be able to set it. After that, it's a great watch. My 7 year old loves it, has been timing things and wears it all the time., Beautiful watch. Very substantial. Wish it had a little more bling...but it's elegantly subtle., Nice watch box. It has some details in the box, like little scratches and the division of the space inside is not so uniform, but it will work., Excellent, I have had this watch for 2 months now -- absolutely great. No problems at all. Didn't think the band was too stiff, it was fine. The watch itself has to be a little thicker -- that's where the solar cell is. Excellent value.  I do miss the indiglo/light up feature, but none of the solars seem to have that. Probably too much for the battery. When not wearing it, I keep it on a table facing the window that is bright, but not direct beams hitting it. So far, all is good. Only had to adjust the time when it first arrived.  I would like to see it with a black band, a little more dressier.<br />Hopefully, in a few years we will have a wider choice of solar watches available. One has to wonder why we are putting batteries into our landfills when this is available?, Nice watch, particularly like the day/date function, so hard to find in a women's watch.  BUT,  it is VERY heavy and strangely-shaped. It wants to sit on the far outside of my wrist, so I have to turn it toward me to read it EVERYTIME.  Strap is soft, but the keepers are not anchored, so they move and the end of the strap sticks out.  Most certainly not worth the $495 price tag on it.  Just barely worth the $40+, I paid., Purchased just for the deployment clasp, its the best!, The parts are well made, I would have preferred the face to be a bit larger in diameter., The watch is fine but the band is useless.  The pins keep working themselves loose and the bracelet opens dropping the watch and link-parts to the floor.  It has done that 3 times while just wearing it.  Assuming you can find the pin and the parts of the link, it's easy enough to put back together, but obviously not an ideal situation and also a bit embarrassing when your watch falls apart on your wrist!  I guess I need to find a replacement watch band as the watch itself is fine., This watch has last my husband through day in and day out of hard manual work. Great watch. Exceptional quality., Beautiful, large face & looks very expensive!, When you put it on the watch it didn't stick too well it continue to come off so I got rid of it!, Beautiful, Worked flawlessly and easy to use., The watch is exactly described. Very quick shipping. Came with the original warranties and everything nice, A really fun watch;  great summer color;  keeps perfect time and I can tell the time without my reading glasses!, Looks a litte cheap, Well made with no sharp edges and opens and closes easily., Very unique watch I am retarded because it's too small for me but these beautiful, This watch is exactly what I wanted<br />:)<br />- Just like the picture (Maybe a tad more matte/flat than the picture) (Looks even better in my opinion)<br /><br />- Everything works properly<br />):<br />-  Minor scratches on first link (Bought new) just like many other people said<br /><br />Overall: 4.9/5<br />Everything is how I wanted it to be, looks nice, great price, looks better than my brother's $150 Guess watch, it was a little too big for me. Spent $10 to adjust it at a shop and it fit perfect (Obviously not the manufactures fault, for the price I bought this it wasn't really a big deal)<br /><br />Clean design and look, definitely would recommend., The watch is terrific and lasts a long time. I've used a DB-37H for years. The only problem is the resin watchband which breaks after 3 years of continuous use. But the band replacement costs $15-16 and a new watch costs $18 so it's a simple decision to buy a new watch!, Was delivered yesterday.  Pretty decent quality, comes with 4 different types of fitting inserts.  Has 3 total contact points,  I could only use 2 as my fossil wasn't  big enough to allow the third round engage the notch on the back.  Great product for those like me who would rather do it themselves than pay a jeweler. Would definitely recommend, One of the best watches, I purchased on Amazon.  This is a very nice and rugged looking watch. For the price it's<br />Worth a buy. Both the analog and digital compliment each other. I have seen other watches with Analog and digital face. But this watch looks like a expensive one. 5 STARS. Definitely a watch to have if you are a watch lover. ; ), Still testing the acurary but after month of use , all I can say by far one if the best gadgets I now own., My husband receives a LOT of gifts purchased from Amazon! This watch is wonderful, bold, masculine, eye catching and can be read easily. (His 60+ year old eyes have trouble seeing the time on digital watches.)  It is rather large but he is a big guy and can handle the look, if you are slight or medium build it may be too much watch.  The only issue so far is the battery had to be replaced after less than 2 months but as he said we don't know how long the battery was in the watch prior to purchase.  Quick delivery, beautifully packaged, inexpensive compared to watch prices in stores that were not half as attractive.  Great purchase!, Package is very good. Worth the money. It would be 5stars if the clasp were not so tight, had thought time opening it. Hope it loosen a little over time. Only feature missing for me is missing the days., Amazing watch. Looks better than in pics., Having issues.  Who do i get in touch with to make the repair, The watch looks a lot better in person then the picture!!!!, Nice, but I can put it on without unclasping the band and I have an 7 1/2&#34; wrist.  Will need to take it to a jeweler to have several links removed.  I guess that's better than trying to figure out how to get extra links., It's amazing, Watch the mail is poor, will be sending back, cannot figure out how to set month and date., so beautiful - thank you., Did not like the watch . HEAVY and BULKY., Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, exellent, I love this watch! It's so pretty and looks just like it's pictured. The only drawback is that it's a bit loose on my wrist so I'll need to get 1-2 links removed but all in all an excellent watch!, Arrived as shown in perfect condition. Beautiful watch!, Getting tons of compliments on the watch the first day of wearing it. Truely unique design., Pros:<br />~Works as expected,<br />~Beautiful minimalist look,<br />~Well built<br /><br />Cons:<br />~Needs resizing - possible to do yourself, not hard.<br />~Sometimes the time is off.  Most of the time the clock is on, and working great, however sometimes it changes by a few minutes wither forward or back.  Once it had been off by several hours, although this hasn't happened since., piece of crap, got water in in the very first day, and I was just pooring!!, So far so good.  Love the look and style of the watch.  Its also very comfortable.  If it holds up well I plan on buying another for camping., I love that this watch comes with 2 catches because I have small wrists.  All I had to do was unsnap one catch and it fit perfectly.  This watch is made really well with a very secure catch.  I have gotten so many compliments on it.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a watch that looks like it costs much more than I paid here for it., Was received in poor quality and NOT in new condition. Should have gotten it cheaper, rather not go through the mission and let you know I was lied to., I read reviews but I don't do them myself, but I will review this one the watch is beautiful., Bought this for boyfriend who had this exact watch many years ago and loved it. This one stopped working after a few weeks. I sent it in to Casio for replacement parts, worked for another couple of weeks then stopped again. Piece of junk! Don't buy., Low quality materials (what do you expect spending 5 bucks?). Display doesn't even work correctly. That being said, I still like the &#34;alien&#34; look, so I'll keep it., It's like a junk watch very cheap materials., exellent, Perfect fass delivery, Very nice.  Wish it was easier to remove links to make it shorter.  Not sure its possible with this bracelet.  Would be great if they could engineer<br />this to be easier to remove links., I bought in 30 june. But i just use watches in 28 july. Final it becam in water n stainless. I feel so hopeless about it. This is gift for my husband, Awesome for any celtics fan!, Vey attractive not too large pearl face. Good looking bracelet (I was looking for chrome and gold) and didn't want a large chunky look. So far the timekeeping has been fine and I am altogether happy with the purchase., Great automatic for this price point. Good power reserve (about 36 hours) and accuracy within +/- 10 seconds per day. Later saw it $50 cheaper on Jomashop, so not happy about that, but Seiko pricing is pretty variable. Would have preferred white (no glare) dial over silver., Beautiful, classy watch, I bought this because I was tired of feeling so reliant on my phone for little calculations or to see what time it is. Now, I feel a lot less chained to my phone and it is wonderful. The display is clear and easy to read, and the strap doesn't bother my skin. The buttons are small and take a little getting used to, but that is to be expected because the watch is not overly large. I was worried it would be too big or bulky on my wrist, but it is the perfect size for a wristwatch. Will certainly buy another if something happens to this one., perfect, Nothing like the original. Lighter weight material and shorter in length. Feels cheap., Thanks you it came faster than the set date and it looks amazing, I broke one of my straps on my LG G watch... this was a pretty cheap replacement. They work perfectly., Vibrating alarm works fantastic.  I need it because I have to wake people up in the middle of the night ,so they can go to work.  A normal alarm on watches I can't hear ,because of there tone,but the vibrating alarm worked everytime.  Occupation, corrections officer., I received this watch and when I opened the package, all I could say is &#34;wow&#34;. This watch is awesome in every way! It definitely has the look and quality of a much more expensive watch! I have several Invicta's and this is definitely one of my favorites already! You wont be sorry if you purchase this watch!!, It's a terrific watch., Durable value that looks good while your swimming.  Kick up your favorite outfit with a little inexpensive to apply<br />color!, Awesome watch,my second one too,the strap broke after two years on the other shark I had so I got this white one and love it more than the last, Looks great - especially paired with this band - the only disappointment is band scratches. 100 meter water resistance, Served its purpose well in an austere environment.  The straps lasted about 3 months a piece.  Cheap enough not to care about throwing away once it served its purpose.  No issues with watch face.  Easy to see the watch face in low illumination., Rolex Daytona-looking watch; not exactly but fairly close. Invicta however, is a good brand that stands on its own; so there is no detriment to the sporting a look-a-like version of he Daytona., I own many watches some very expensive for occasional use and this is my favorite everyday watch, I have this in a lot of colors for work. I love it. Completely water proof, has the date and is super cute. Not too big, not too small., Amazing, stylish and small., The watch is a definite conversation piece--everyone comments how cool it is. The band is small for a nan's wrist but large for a woman's. I don't know if links can be removed as there was no documentaion/booklet accompanying the watch. The clasp is very difficult to operate. The watch is cheaply made--don't expect it to last long. I paid very little for it so that's fine. And, as I said previously, it is a real conversation piece. It's a fun piece of jewelry., Just like the picture., I like this watch. It has become one of my favorites. I own too many others to list, but when I think it could have a wider bracelet and clasp. I remember that I can sleep with it on. Others are too uncomfortable. I get compliments on this one while $2K watches g0o unnoticed. Built almost as good as my Omega... maybe better as that one needs $300 in repair or more., beautiful, It is not water proof. When I washed my hands water came in, I had to pay over $24 in order to get cleaned, Lasted all of 1 month before breaking., Not atomic., I am completely satisfied of this simple and elegant design.<br />My wife really like it., Work for my dad, Even better in person than in the photo.  Comfortable and keeps perfect time!, Everything came as expected  very happy with size and ease of operation  of warch, Quite nice for an inexpensive time piece, Wrist band can not be adjusted beyond 3/8 inch. So to wear it is sloppy and useless, Very cute, but it (the strap) broke very quickly., Sent first one back because the ball part fell out of the ring part. Got a replacement and the same thing happened.  Poorly made., Got this watch for my son as a graduation present from Air Force BMT. Defintely worth the money I paid for! Very durable and beautifully presented in its box! It's a large watch, which suits my son just fine! He absolutely loved it, as well as his MTI!, A little light and the face was hard for my husband to see. Nice looking watch though!!, I love it. Better than i expect. It came at time. Thanks!!<br />Sorry for this late review. I'm from Venezuela., When I first opened the box, the watch looked fantastic and people thought I spent nearly $100 on it. However within 10 days water got under the glass and condensed on it and consistanly looks foggy making it difficult to read and looks bad. The glass can not be removed to fix this problem. Also the finish is wearing down and tarnishing quickly., So far so good, I didn't counter any problems with this product. It looks like 200dollar watch but it only cost 22 dollars. Only complain is the format of digital gauge which states: hours/seconds/minutes, Was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it!  Very fast shipping...thank you!!, Looking good and really expensive. For the first time there were some problems with second and minute hand (they used to go faster or slower), but in 2 days everything went okay. Maybe the mechanism got used to my wrist moves.))<br />Awesome, worth buying!, For the price of these watches, I expected them to be cheap-looking and feeling. They serve their purpose,as of now they're still working and no damages yet. Not too bad for its price, I would say. I only got what I paid for., It's a good looking watch and the multiple dials do indeed work. However, the smaller dials can be difficult to read and the glow feature doesn't emit a lot of light. If the arms were the same color as the hand, it would be much easier to read. All in all, it keeps time accurately and for the money, you can't go wrong., Broke pretty fast, I'm happy with my present from my husband., Description said it had a unidirectional bezel, but it does not move..band also too short., Seems well made feels good but product does not come with instructions and i cant look up how to set watch and tell the time on it. Looks cools tho, I like this watch a lot. It stays wound for a whole weekend and has a durable metal watch band. I've been using it for 10 months and it's my go to watch now. Only complaint is that there is not enough color contrast between the watch hands and the background gears. Not a huge issue for me, but I did take off one star because of it., Easy install, fits perfectly, and it's actually an improvement on the watch, since it seems to resist the smudging from fingerprints like the bare watch face easily gets., Slim, comfortable, attractive, easy to read, and never needs batteries. And it's a Seiko. What more can you expect in a watch?, A very solid watch all round. My eyesight isnt amazing which has made it difficult to set the watch but I suppose my next purchase will be glasses! I would highly recommend this watch! I am a happy customer!, Arrived just as shown in pictures, I like that the display doesn't waste area on crap like seconds twirly wheels or maps of the world. The date is large enough to read without a magnifying glass like the display area wasting watches. I didn't give 5 stars because the band is VERY difficult to resize. The instructions that came with the watch didn't mention resizing! I had to go to the web and found a YouTube video that showed how to remove the clips holding the segments together., awesome little set, everything i need, There is no question that the winder functions well; I do have some serious concerns that the rotations will scratch my two most expensive automatic watches because of the plastic watch inserts rubbing against the plastic slots during rotation !  Given my limited navigation skills,it would be appreciated if you would forward this message to the product link of the manufacturer !, I normally do not wear a watch, but I found a need.  My iPhone's vibration for incoming calls or text messages just isn't strong enough to always get my attention.  Using a watch that can vibrate on my wrist sure fixed that issue and this Casio (for it's price point) found its way to me.  Many of the &#34;poor&#34; reviews spoke of the blue tooth being to week.  I don't know why they are stating that because the range for me has been awesome.  I can plug the phone in have way across my house and I'm still getting the notifications without fail.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is due to the fact the blue tooth isn't native.  You have to have the Casio App running at all times to keep the connection.  In a way, the app has it's high points ~ gives you additional features if you set it into Music Control and you can designate keys on the watch to perform functions.  It also integrates with other apps on my iPhone like MapMyWalk, and I can then use the watch to show my split times/distance/etc. without pulling the phone out of a pocket.  For those that are running and have their phone mounted on their arm this is sure to be a huge plus.  Not sure if the app is native to the phone's blue tooth, but still it works.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the watch.  Wish I could give a Half Star to have it lean a bit more to a five., The outer ring of the clock does not line up with the rest. 9 is wrong and in 60 of the crown is a defect. The second hand of the clock will not be aligned properly. I contacted the seller for a replacement. This picture shows everything  Edit: Now the button for resetting the clock is depressed and no longer start.It sucks, maybe it's not even original. Seller uncaring, absolutely not recommended, Watch was okay,but watch pens kept coming out while fastening the watch, Hard to program.  Directions are incorrect!, The item is so heavy and bulky...totally not  good at daily wear...plus... The compass doesn't work well...just have no reason to keep it and take 2 weeks to get refund and the as the action from the seller is so slow...didn't get full amount of money I paid without explaining why...definitely would not recommend..., The leather band is high quality.  The bezeled edge surrounding the face gives the case class.  The shape of the hands catch the light, no matter what direction it is coming from, making it easy to read the time.  This watch is going to fit right in with my classic black performance attire<br />., worth the money has all the bells and whstles, I love this watch! Simple and easy to read., The case on this watch is absolutely astonished. i have had several friends comment that it looks just a submariner from 5 feet away, but when you get closer you see the invicta logos. great quality case and the movement is beautiful, 6 ticks a second, compared to 8 of the rolex. My only gripe is the band, the clasp is A1 but the links feel light and cheap, they also scratch rather easily. I recoomend a new band if you want this as your daily watch, a black nylon/rubber band would also go well with this model. All in all a great watch fro 90 bucks and if you are thinking about getting the watch, you should!, Good coloring, matches my LG G Watch R pretty well, so I'm happy in that aspect.  The downfall of this is specific to people with hairy arms/wrists like me.  Beware of the occasional pinching of your arm hair because every edge on this watch band has a somewhat &#34;cut&#34; edge, aka - they didn't really refine the finished product as far as smoothing their edges and parts on the actual band.  This creates the ideal opportunity for hair pulling.  Also, the clasp is a bit unusual in the way it latches, however you get used to it quickly.  The overall price vs. quality outs this a notch above the rest, because you really can't find a decently made band with this good of a color profile for this low of a price., Perfect, love the weight of the ceramic & it's easy to read. Elegant and not cheap-looking like many rose-gold items can be. Very nice and keeps perfect time., I've gotten more compliments on this watch than any watch I've ever owned. However, the post that holds the latch closed broke off in only 2.5 years, so I'm only giving it 2 stars because that's not a very long life. Fossil wanted to charge me almost half of what the watch is worth to fix it., The chime is nice and I like the night sensor function that does not allow the chime at night. The look is elegant and classic. Seiko is a reliable brand to trust. I like this wall clock., My husband had one like it and lost it and had to have another one.  Many people admire it when he is wearing it., Just received a Reactor Gamma as a gift. Very impressed with the high quality design and materials. This watch is well balanced, strong, light and beautiful in it's design with the decorative etching on the centre of the links, crown and around the bezel. An all titanium, day/date dive watch with tritium tubes and rated to 300 metres. Special attention has been given to a unique fastening system securing the titanium watch band to the titanium case. Even the case back is heavy duty in it's design and comfortable to wear. Something you don't see in many higher priced watches. It has got to be one of the best rated luminous watches on the market, even the second hand shines brightly. The Japanese Quartz movement is accurate and reliable. It fit my wrist with an additional two more micro adjustments straight out of the incredible case I use as a stubby cooler for my beer. Just another example of the thought gone into designing a time piece anyone would be happy to own or receive as a gift. Fortunately the watch was purchased before the Australian government introduces a Goods and Services Tax on &#34;all&#34; items bought off the internet, coming soon for those of us living &#34;Down Under.&#34; This watch is beautiful, reliable an at an incredibly affordable price. I would recommend Reactor Gamma to anyone looking for a great titanium, day/date dive watch that's &#34;Never Dark&#34; to read. P.S. Fakes are in all brands these days. Watches should only be bought from an authorised dealer or reseller to insure authenticity., This watch is elegant, sleek and very stylish. It was much more than I expected., This watch died after about a year, but it was on the wrist of a very active kid and took a lot of dirt and abuse. The strap held up very well as did the body of the watch. Something inside malfunctioned ... probably got mud in there somehow... and it locked up, killed the battery and died. It didn't last as long as we'd hoped, but for the money, it did a great job. I'd buy another., I bought this watch as an anniversary gift for my husband.  The actual watch wasn't nearly as pretty as the picture showed.  I returned it immediately and received a full refund., Like the watch overall but it was shipped with a defect. One of the three small aiguilles fell off., Only watch I own and wear. Never really been a jewelry guy, but I got a wedding ring not too long ago so this matches that pretty well I'd say. I get a lot of complements on this wrist-bound chronograph too. I guess some people think it makes me look grown up or something., This is a very good watch.  keeps EXCELLENT time and looks a lot more expensive than it really is.  Can pass for stainless and real gold and diamonds.  Really.  Would make a very nice gift for any woman.  Can be dressy or everyday.  That's what I love about it.  Even went swimming with it for minute or two and no problem., Unbelievable bargain at $69.00.  Better than anticipated., The watch was too big for my wrist. I gave it to my daughter and she probably will like it. I wish it was a little smaller face and band like the<br />previous Geneva watch I ordered., Great product, especially at sale price. I've gotten lots of complements in a professional setting (healthcare) and wear it almost every day. The band was originally fairly large, but it was not particularly difficult to remove links myself., Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it literally stopped working within 45 days. I even took it to a watch store to have the battery checked but they couldn't even get it running again. Too bad it's past the return date., Beautiful watch with the heft of a quality timepiece., It revives my Kinetic  Seiko. So far, It works wonderfully..., Great value. Looks sharp. Mine was a bit scuffed on the non-clasp end when it arrived. It's mostly gone now and not noticeable. It seems to scuff somewhat easily but a bit of mink oil takes card of it. It's also more narrow at the end than the photo suggests... i'm guessing it's 20mm at the end but i'll try to measure and update this. My photo's make it look wider as I have small wrists. The horizontal thread on the ends by the spring bar looks a bit cheap like it might fray in a year or so. I wasn't expecting a Breitling band for $30 bucks either., This brand new item is defective and is not working properly. I regret buying watch, how on earth a &#34;new&#34; watch can be sold on Amazon and when purchased And received the very next stop working. I am embarrassed., There is no manual operation. When I cross the watch band into lock, but I dont open the lock. So now I can not wear the watch. Can you tell me how to use it by my email?, I have several Android watches, and just like the others this does not disappoint. A nice swiss movement, &#34;wet&#34; black ceramic band, and a 50mm face, the watch is very substantial with nice details. Though large in size, it is very comfortable on the wrist. Overall, a great buy for the money., excellent..., Excellent watch for the price. Looks much better in hand than in photos. Liked it enough to buy a second one. Main sweep hand and all hands on sub-dials are spot on. Might get the orange face version., Arrived quickly.  Watch was a nice size and a nice design.  However watch face mother-of-pearl finish was defective.  It appeared the finish was applied too thin and some parts of the watch face didn't receive the finish.  The result was splotchy and unattractive.  A couple of the rhinestones on the side were misaligned as well.  I wonder if this was a factory second.  It is being returned., I had scratched the face of my watch after bumping against a grantite counter top. Some were superficial and one was deeper over the center of the face that made the face unreadable  in certain light conditions. The product worked better than expected and with 2 applications and heavy buffing the superficial scratches are completely gone. The only evidence of the deep scratch is a slight linear distortion in the face when looked at an angle with the right light., This is an amazing watch and has all the bells and whistles also a large size.  It is a man's Swiss Legend Highlander Display Quartz Black watch that will keep any man on time.  This rugged watch is well made with all the push buttons needed and in a stainless steel case with heavy leather strap.  I found the strap easy to work with and strap on your wrist.  Very slick looking with a large face black in color to match the black straps with red stitching. This stainless steel watch body but has black face with a light red tint to the numbers and markings.<br />Hurry quick to Amazon.com as it is on for sale for $54.99 a sure bargain for this stream lined watch with all the things one needs to keep yourself on time.,  Great looking watch so check it out and look for Swiss Legends 10020-01-RDA a real good bargain., i have been buying this same watch for years. only issue is the plastic band, i wish it came with black leather., Best quality watch ever, Purchased for myself but gave it to my girlfriend because it was on the small side for a male. She loves it though, Beautiful watch, I can not find them steel bracelet, loved it .. but you can see how the color of real gold looks like and the gold color of the watch 😁.. but even though I recommend it, I liked it, A beautiful watch band that took a nice watch and made it FABULOUS!  Thank you!, loose and floppy.  makes a lot of noise when it dangles on my wrist.  distracting.  Also and obviously, cheaply made., what I expected, PROS:<br />-all the resistances g-shock boasts about (see cons for the ones it doesn't cover since there are too many)<br />-light weight for the size<br />-very clear and easy to read the time for an aviation watch<br />-everything but the bezel is fairly easy to clean<br />-black pvc metal case that holds the watch is very strong (and can scratch other stainless steel watches if you tried)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-face of bezel gets dirty easily (where it says N(orth), E(east), S(outh), W(est) but hard to clean if you like your watches clean (ironically)<br />-the date of the month is difficult to read at first glance, especially where light is weak/absent<br />-glow in the dark is great the first 2 hours tops, there is no backlight either (really wish they did)<br />-not anti magnetism<br />-hesitant to take underwater (scuba) since it is an aviation time piece (so sad) but you can still swim with it<br />(for those who pretty much live in the water, i recommend the g-shock frogman).<br /><br />I work an office job and have received many compliments because it is a beautiful time piece. Other outdoorsmen in my office have inquired about its ability and functions as well., This is a piece of junk. With a little pressure it split apart and the black ring for the handle came apart. I am now attempting to salvage with super glue for both broken and defective areas on the tooL?. I got a free one with a stainless band for an apple watch that actually worked. Apparently, sellers found a way to make another dollar instead of offering added value to the customer. I definitely wouldn't order this again and could not in good conscience encourage anyone to order it. I gave one star for amazon's quick delivery., Impressive looks, heavy and well made. Have received positive comments from complete strangers as well as friends., A great clock with quiet moving hands. Easy to read at darkness., I wanted the reviews about it not being unisex to be false. I wanted the second hand and digital features but it is unwearable. If you have small wrists you will not be able to wear this., I own a 8926ob which is awesome also bought a 9094ob  which is the blue version of the 8926ob  came across  this model  which has a scalloped bezel an smoke gray insert  an it is just as awesome  as the other two pro divers I own also has the seiko nh35a  movement  and came with a dive case an for 49.00 I have to say it's the best deal of it all in my opinion  the automatic  pro diver series  is the best deal period better  than orient an parnis but you already  know you have invicta  haters but I really  don't think they own one or else they would know how awesome  they really are all mine run at cosc levels  an internals are far superior  then the other two brands I mentioned  an yes you can hack and wind unlike the other two brands I mentioned  so if you ever had any doubt  about invicta pro diver line I hope this helps you a little take it from me I've got three with perfect  accuracy  an completely  water proof, Will order again., Beautiful watch like rolex, a little heavy but nice watch, The winding crown fell out shortly after my girl started wearing it and while we found it and were able to get it repaired, it cost us money to do that.<br />Hard to read the numbers so to tell time it could be a lot better (although I'm not expecting much from such a small face.), Very nice watch. Durable and attractive. Only flaw is the top dial catches in my hair if i do not take it off to do my hair and it pulls it., Very, very cute (although it's smaller than I expected on my larger hands). Love the leather, the rose gold, the easy-to-read face. My only complaint is that the chronograph is pretty difficult to figure out (it's easy to accidentally reset it to &#34;0&#34;) and ultimately isn't that useful. Also, a small amount of glue is visible where the decorative leather sits on top of the strap on either side of the watch face, and it's peeling just a little bit. Other than those very small issues, I love it!, It is perfect! The band is so soft and there were enough holes to fit even around my tiny wrist. It is so pretty and in case you didn't know, Fossile gives a 11 year warranty for your watch!, Watch fits well, I love the shinny bezel. The display back is fun and the leather band is stiff but very sturdy feeling. I like this better than the bambino from Orient (but that is a good watch also), The watch was purchased as a gift for a child. Visually, the watch seems to be well made and operative.  What I was not fond of was the difficulty to set the time.  For some reason you can adjust the digital time but not the analog. Thats a bummer, especially for a kid., Beautiful watch. Prices are all over the place when looking online., Very nice, a different color, that looks really beautiful. Perfect for my wife., Cheap but &#34;not cheap made&#34;., Awesome watch, you will not be disappointed!, I work in an a medical setting where I'm constantly washing my hands. I need a watch that can handle that. Furthermore, I need a watch with a big enough display to show me the time and date without putting my readers on. This watch meets both needs very well!, Nice simple watch. Only had it a few days so I can't comment on durability. Only thing that I wish was different is the lugs. Should be able to change the strap., junk, Dissappointed. The baby on the shirt is well below my pregnant belly, at the bottom of the shirt. Not what was pictured., Have two other hilfiger watches, one mainly blue bezel, one mainly gold...this combines them, bluish backdrop, gold outlay.  My new favorite watch.  Looks like it cost 10 times what it did.  The bezel is a bit thick but not overbearing.  Love it., I just received this and it literally smells like someone urinated on it. Otherwise, it seems okay, but now I have to wash my brand new watch., cool watch, Hard to fix time. N belt is little hard to put on hand n taking off. My son is a big fan of paw patrol so I bought it. But not good as I was expecting., Small and portable. I like the flip cover that covers up the buttons when it's packed and opens into a stand when you arrive. I take this on all of my trips now (sometimes that cell phone you intend to use as your alarm runs down). When I'm home, I use it in my bathroom to keep an eye on the time while I'm getting ready in the morning., Good quality. Got several compliments, Excellent, works as well as an original Casio G-Shock. I wanted to try it since I had to pawn my G-Shock and for the money I paid for the original one I could buy four of these. I am very pleased., Got this for my 8 year old son. He loves it. Nice and loud and he's able to play with it. Its like an oversized Lego dude., looks like a much more expensive watch and nobody knows the difference, It is a little big, so more like a bracelet. Very cute., excellent, Looks way different from the picture, Love my new Harley Davidson bulova watch great packaging arrived in 3 days thumbs up to Amazon and Milwaukee Harley Davidson, battery was dead, not the right one, Beautiful daytime watch!, A very attractive watch  with fun features that might work ACCURATELY? I've had it out of the box for five hours and just went to my IMac to contact Amazon for a return slip.Two minutes for the slip, my card will be credited and all I have to do is pack it up and back to the UPS store. Pretty easy. Main problem, you have to hold the watch to your ear to hear the alarm and no adjustment. I've owned many Casio's and I use the alarm system to wake me on hunts and camp outs. Not my ears but the watch. If you need an ALARM, don't buy. Before I ordered I checked the reviews but only checked the first 15 or so. Great ratings. GO DEEPER, past the first 15 as I did to see if my watch just had a bad noise maker. Quite a few comments on the alarm. Of more note, the band gets the worst ratings. Pins falling out, scratches, etc. After thirty days Casio tells you to take a hike as concerns the band. If you like the features of the watch and can live without the alarm then purchase the resin band version with the understanding that the US Navy doesn't issue this unit to SEALS, they would get lost., I'll start my review by reminding everyone this is a sub-$20 watch so I encourage you to keep your expectations in check. If so, this Casio probably exceeds most of them. It's unapologetically plastic, but that is to be expected. Overall, the water resistance is excellent. I had a $200+ Victorinox water resistant watch also to 100 m which fogged up while this did not. Also, for those who claim that the luminous hands don't work, it does. I tested it by closing the door to the basement and with the aid of a very bright flashlight, the luminous watch hands glowed very brightly. However, it does have a tendency to die off as time goes on and may require a &#34;jumpstart&#34; by flashlight every once in a while. The timekeeping is very accurate. Overall, an excellent purchase., Excellent, Classic, simple watch meets my needs exactly., This watch is the perfect mix of dress and sporty flair. I originally bought this watch to be a dress watch thin enough to slip underneath a dress shirt cuff but. Not long I  found my self wearing it casually, however I would not wear it for swimming, working out, or on the job. The chronograph feature is fully functional and captivating every time I turn it on. My one quirk is that it is sometimes hard to see the silver hand over the sun burst silver dial especially in direct sun light. When it comes down to it, this is a beautiful product from Orient for the price. Think form factor, check. Chronograph down to a tenth of a sec., check. Domed crystle, bonus., THIS ONE IS FOR MY FRIEND!SHE LIKE IT VERY MUCH!LOOKS VERY NICE  AND ITS REAL STUFF! THANK YOU SO MUCH!I WILL BE BACK IF I NEED!, SO SMALL! Sending it back., This is a really small watch. It is not 46mm at all. It looks more like baby G-shock. I gave it to my 11 year old son. What a disappointment. Usually G-shocks are huge but this is the exception., Not unlike the similar Invicta watches, the advertised MSRP on these watches is pure fiction.<br />That said, it is a very nice watch, in weight, style and functionality.<br />It also fills a niche, again not unlike the inexpensive range of Invicta watches, it boasts a Swiss movement, chronograph, world time and other features. Mineral scratch proof glass is also a plus.<br />There are some inconsistencies over more higher priced watches, like having a screw down crown, but open push buttons? The description tells you that it is 100m water resistant and that means swimming and showering, but NOT diving, and the absence of the aforementioned non screw down function buttons alone should tell you that.<br />This is an impressive looking timepiece, with a price tag that certainly belies it's quality. People will think it is much more expensive than it is, I have been complimented on it already.<br />I own several Invicta watches, and a Swiss Legend &#34;Hanowa&#34; which I have had for several years, and I would place this watch above Invicta but still in that &#34;cheaper&#34; bracket.<br />I wear a watch everyday, feel naked without one, and being able to wear something that is more than functional, but won't break the bank if I damage or lose it, is a winner in my book.<br />The only thing I would have liked is a &#34;bubble&#34; over the date which is hard to see (especially with my need for reading glasses these days) but other than that I recommend this watch. 4 stars, I believe this watch has featutres most enthusiast would appreciate, for an out door type. The Lcd is legible. The sensors take a little more time to compute than most other casio lines like the gshock rangeman. Go for the titanium, its hardy, durable, and sits sharp on the wrist., Beautiful!!!, I got it to use it with my Pebble Time watch and Apple Watch and love how well it fits my large wrists.  Keeping in mind most watch bands or straps are small on my wrist.  This one felt perfect as far as its size is concerned.  Anyways, I just love the end result.  Reminder for the Pebble Time watch you probably need to buy the bar separately since the strap does not include the bar. The same goes for the Apple Watch, which I needed to use a converter piece, I got from amazon.  Yep I bought 2 straps cause I liked it that much., My third one.  Need to say more??  Just in case, I lost one and I managed to break the glass on the other (freak accident), Watch came broken.  The little knob, to change the time was crooked and it wouldn't move.... so the hands stayed where they were, never moved.<br />It never &#34;activated&#34; the battery either. ....<br />So essentially,  it never worked.<br /> I bought like 4 or 5, forlittle stocking gifts,  the others worked great,  but this one was a lemon.<br /><br />Sadly, I never had a chance to return it.<br /><br />It  Wasnt worth the hassle *or the  cost of mailing it back to China! !<br /><br />So now,  I only buy things that are sold on &#34;Amazon Prime&#34;. I learned my lesson the hard way., I love this clock- as far as the quality goes it's great! The arms and legs move and it's like a giant Lego! My boys love it but both were disappointed that the backlight does not stay on therefore you can't see the time in the dark! I agree with the others that the alarm sound could be louder and be Star Wars related. It's a cute clock but not a night light!, The booklet with the directions is so small I can barely read it. Not only is the print extremely small but the directions are confusing. I have NOT been able to even use it and I've had it for a week. Very disappointed. I even pulled up the directions up online but so confusing., I love it. It looks like a picture., This watch it so stylish and cheap. I don't knwo what else you need to hear. I've had it for over a year and it's survived through all the swimming, and banging, Other than a few scratches, that were completely my fault, it's still good as new. The fact that it can also be backlit is really helpful too., Fraud. Item not as described, Disappointed that after just 2 uses..a already have a broken piece!!  You get what you pay for?!, Super cute and it works great! The gold and white look amazing together and I jut find it so cute, Had another weekender timed watch. Loved it but broke crystal after a biking accident. Kept on ticking though. Not worth repairing so bought another one. This was an exceptional deal. Often see the cost range from $23-$60. Don't know if there really<br /> is any difference besides the band and variations on the face. Never had to replace battery on old one even after 3-4 years. The face lights up when you press the stem. Nice feature when in the dark.  Looks very styish and looks more expensive then it is., It is normal., Great quality watch and super clean. The black stainless steel is excellent quality for the price that you pay. You really pay for what you get with this one, an excellent watch non the less. The orange contrast greatly with the black steel , and comes with a handy link remover that is useful for any watch beyond just this one. Overall  a successful purchase, the presentation is superb, and i hope BUREI comes out with more watches., So far it's lasted longer than a Timex I'd had that was twice as expensive.  I'm going cheap from now on., My grand daughter DIYA was thrilled to receive it., Pros:<br /> * The woven steel band is surprisingly supple and comfortable. It also hasn't snagged any of my arm hair, which I was actually concerned about.<br /> * Clear and easy-to-read face, although the markings and hands could be a little larger.<br /> * Looks slick and thin<br /> * Quiet (I got it because my Timex ticked too loudly). It's practically silent, except once a minute when the minute hand moves.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> * Repositioning the clasp is difficult. I had to use a screwdriver to pry it open and pliers to press it back together. The instructions don't cover this procedure. And my pliers scratched the metal (which doesn't really matter, because you can't see the scratches while wearing the watch). Minus one star.<br /> * The metal band has a row of shallow divots where the clasp can attach. I'm using the shortest setting, about 6.5 inches total length. If you have a smaller wrist, you're out of luck, unless you're willing to risk damaging your watch. (I didn't try attaching the clasp outside of the divots, but I wouldn't recommend it. I was already afraid of breaking the clasp with my pliers.) Minus one star.<br /> * No date calendar (should have been obvious from the picture; I don't blame them for this)., everything perfect I stay well, recommended seller 100%, Of course you get what you pay for, so remember that.  The watch band has to be immediately replaced, as it literally fell apart the first time I tried to put it on. $5 for a new watch band and the piece itself still looKS really cool. Just remember it's not waterproof., bought it as a gift, Not very water resistant but definitely cute and functional., It does fit the Casio MDV106 watch. If you have a sanding drum in a moto tool and the paitence to file down the ends to allow the spring bars to engage the lugs. And provided you have the original 22mm spring bars from your watch and not attempt to use the 20mm spring bars that came with this unit. After a half hour to forty five minute sanding session, the band fits. Once it is made to fit, the band is not bad. Hence the three stars. Yes It was less than ten bucks so what did I expect. Actually the bracelet part is very good for the price., Didnt work for Luminox 3000 series watch.  Waste of money.  Came off in a week, original pins would not fit throug straps.  Had to use the included pins, straps kept coming off my watch.  Useless, Whats not to like, its a overly expensive clock that tells you the temperature of your wall. But seriously, you can get the exact same thing for half or even a third the price. I am a lover of nice things and Braun makes nice things. My clock hangs on a wall that has no insulation to the outdoors. The temperature shown is not the temperature of the room but of the wall., Beautiful, stunning.  See a full video review on YouTube at mainspringreviews., Who needs anything over $20 (Gshock included)? This performs all the same functions, is durable, and a fraction of the cost!, Grandson is so happy with his watch., Watch band broke on the second day, Cheap but, its clear fro, the purchase info, what your getting., Very classy and durable watch! Love it!<br />It will most likely have to be sized to fit your wrist but that is a given with most clasp style watches., It broke the first time it went in the water. do not buy it., I got this watch and liked it so much I got it in two more colors.  It's big, so be ready.  But I like a big face and, besides, this isn't the watch you wear to work with starched cuffs.  Just a great-looking watch that, thus far, has kept perfect time., My daughter bought this for her sister for her 10th birthday and she loves it! It is actually better quality then I thought it would be., Very durable., TOO LARGE AND CUMBERSON, Actually, the snaps wouldn't close, and one of the balls fell off. It wasn't worth my money to send it back, so I gave it away., They gave me watch tool link removal tool for free. Lovely watch., Simple, accurate, ceap.  what else do you want?, Stopped working in two years., Awesome. If your debating about wether you should buy it just do it, only thing I have a problem with is setting the small minute timer and second timer up... but I'm kind of new to the chronograph watches so it's probably just me, I'm sure I'll figure it out soon<br /><br />Update: over a year with this watch and it's still extremely accurate with only minor discrepancies for the date because some months are longer, it works very well under water still I constantly sumberge it and I still get plenty of compliments all the time, Perfect!!, Perfect watch for dressing up!, Nixon as always has delivered another stylish and rugged timepiece., Very normal, very happy with product, I've had this watch for over 12 years. Very classy look; good weight; hair on my wrist does not get caught between the links of the strap as happens with some watch straps; amazingly accurate. Excellent buy at US $210 in Antigua. I take it off only when I shower or if I go into the sea. I actually wore it in the sea a few times, though.<br />There is nothing wrong with the calendar. As stated by an earlier reviewer, the battery must be changed once the watch starts indicating a low battery (the second hand jumps two seconds). If the battery dies completely you will have to reset the calendar.<br />I've had the battery changed twice and unfortunately I waited too long to change the battery each time and neither of the service companies could get the perpetual calendar going but being a do-it-yourselfer, I found the relevant video on youtube and got the calendar fixed.<br />I highly recommend this watch.[[ASIN:B0007N53ZC Seiko Men's SLL086 Perpetual Calendar Watch]], Nice watch for the money japanese movement a little choppy but overall a good buy., Works well. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. The band has kind of stained a bit, probably from rubbing on my clothes (I wear it with my navy scrubs). But otherwise, it's good. Adjusting the date is a little difficult though., I am a big fan of mesh watch straps because they are breathable and comfortable to wear.  I'm so happy Timex finally came out with this one!  I wanted a black face background with silver hands, but most other watches of that style comes with a black steel band.  I don't like black steel bands because the black scrapes off too easily, which makes those watches look really ugly after a while.  But that won't happen with this watch!  Thanks to the polished uncoated stainless steel casing and band, there's nothing that will chip off over time!  In addition, this watch is stylish, easy to read, comfortable, glows in the dark, and has the treasured indiglo light up function that Timex is famous for.  Out of all the watches I've owned, this is definitely my favorite!, I have over twenty watches, from an Omega Seamaster to a fifteen dollar Casio.  This is the finest built looking watch I have ever seen or owned.  I have nothing to say other than it's definitely worth the roughly $400 I paid for it., Really pleased with this watch.  The only thing I'd change would be to add some luminescence to the hands.  However, with the light it's easy to read at night.  (For a quick glance at the time ).<br />It is lighter than the picture so look at some of the reviews on you tube for a better idea of the color. I love the color.<br />It has everything I need in a watch and it's light weight.  It's not too big for a woman.  It's stylish to wear bigger watches., It's ok, just the right size, face is a lot closer to yellow than tan. Looks good, pretty accurate, haven't tested it's water resistance (nor do I plan to), but if that's important to you then look elsewhere, product page states that it's ok with splashes, but not with submersion. This is a decent daily watch if that's what you're looking for., Received this watch very quick! Great brand and quality! (This IS a real Nixon... Unlike the other user said.), I needed a watch for work. It needed to be able to be durable, easy to read, easy to wash and preferably have military time. All thing achieved by this watch. People that complain about the instructions and buttons are probably Morons that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground., If you're not used to a big 50+ mil watch steer clear. It's a big watch but it's oddly comfortable for its size due to the soft rubber band.<br />Seems to run as it should and for the price $61.28 you really can't go wrong. I have been wearing it and for casual situations it is actually growing on me and doesn't appear so Flava-Flave to me anymore., Thank you!, Cute but the crystal lid fell off after a few weeks,, This is a stunningly gorgeous watch. Can wear with jeans or dressier clothes. It just simply goes with everything. I get tons of compliments on it., I've purchased self winders from other vendors here, but this one is ow one of my favorite watches. Keeps good time, actually self winds. Very stylish. Flatly, I love this watch! You CAN NOT BEAT THE VALUE!, High quality watch band.  Time will tell how it holds up.  I expect mo issues though., MK has done it again. This is a very handsome watch. It was a birthday gift for my husband and it definitely makes the man. They spared no expense in design, excellent craftsmanship !!, My first skeleton watch. Pretty cool watch. Very large face. Arrived promptly and in good condition, I've been purchasing Hadley-Roma straps for years. They are reliable, well made moderately priced watchbands. This one is no exception. Coarse grained, genuine leather, not that cheap bonded leather or PU leather. Calfskin wrist lining and superb white stitching. Stainless steel buckle. Save your spring bars, my band did not come with new spring bars. Fits my watch and wrist superbly, perfect, Perfect!, Quality product., Not what was expected, Bought it as a gift and the response was very positive. Very trendy and fashionable. The price is like almost 1/3 of what I saw in stores., I wish I could give this 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Good:  It works great as a watch.  Despite whatever any other complaints I have of it, I've worn it doing tons of different activities and its survived just fine. I've showered with it on accident, done dishes, etc, and it hasn't worn down too bad yet, nor had component failure.  Have had it 2 months and haven't had to correct the time yet.  That's pretty solid for $12 Casio.<br /><br />The bad: The band is super cheap; which was to be expected because, surprise!, so was the watch. In fact, the whole watch looks a little dinky upon close inspection. Looks good from far but far from pretty.<br /><br />Overall; I got what I expected., Nice watch. Was a painful experience adjusting the strap. I suggest going to a jeweler to get that done if you buy one. Or, at least get some tweasers with the watch strap adjustment kit!<br /><br />The watch fits well, the strap--once adjusted--is very secure, with a double fastener. This can be difficult to get off though.<br /><br />The mechanism is keeping good time so far, only had it a week, so difficult to tell just how good it it.<br /><br />The chronograph functions are nice.<br /><br />Not actually got it wet yet, so, cannot confirm the 1,000ft of water--pretty sure the watch would survive and I wouldn't., Beautiful !, excellent, The watch came wrapped very well. Beautiful watch, easy to set & keeps perfect time., I love it!  I just retired and was looking for something casual. The white goes with anything I wear., Cheap junk, pins break easily, Excellent, This watch is lighter than I expected-- maybe just because the band is so light. It looks great! Can't complain for this price. The people complaining about the sound of the second hand clearly don't have any analog clocks in their house; the tick from my alarm clock is much louder. This watch isn't loud at all., It dies all that I wanted of it., Nice watch. Good color, all the sparkly stones are there. Watch function works. The closure fit slightly crooked. This watch is made for a small wrist. Just right for my galpal, she liked it. Great price for a cool &#34;just because' gift., Fits my Casio watch perfectly!, Works very well with my Asus Zenwatch.  Word of warning:  The clasp system complete separates the two sides; it is NOT the style where the clasp system essentially makes the watch band wider so you can take it on and off.  It's a little more complicated to put on, but it's really not that bad.  The tool that is included is garbage (breaks under the slightest amount of force), but thankfully it's not necessary for anything.  You can pry up the little clamp that keeps the adjustable part in place with a knife (be careful!) or a small screwdriver.  Once it's up, tug on it with some force and it will move.  Use both thumbs to push it all the way back down.<br /><br />Unlike the included tool, the band and clasp feel top notch and extremely sturdy.  The two included pins worked fine on my watch.  If you want a metal band without annoying links that can break or have pins fall out, get this guy.  It's a steal at $11., Love the watch! The watch and band have a mirror polish finish. The clasp is very easy to manipulate to open and close. Face is easy to read, but no lume indicators. I have larger wrists that measure around 8 inches and like to wear my watches a little on the loose/relaxed side. It fit perfect for me right out of the box., Beautiful watch! Bought it as a gift for my friend and he loved it! Glad I made this purchase! Thanks Amazon!!! BBnBaB, This watch is beautiful and versatile. It stands out and gets noticed but not so much that it appears gaudy. This is the first watch that I've owned with the larger case size so I have found that it takes some getting used to. But I bought a black Fossil watch of the same dimensions because I liked this one so much. And the 11 yr. Fossil warranty on the mechanics was a deciding purchase point for me. I'm actually looking at getting a 3rd Fossil watch so I have one for every occasion. If you're thinking about it, GO FOR IT!!, Product is as described. Satisfied customer would order from this provider again., Omg! You get what u pay for ... lol I bought 3 of these in different colors and each watch malfuctioned and broke in less than ah week. I couldn't give it zero stars cuz it sure doesn't deserve one star, I really like this watch. I work for a fire dept and as a paramedic, so it nice to have an analog watch that looks nice and traditional, but still have the functionality of the digital display and 24/hr marks on the face. Also it has an illumination button and date/day on the display. All in a watch that costs 50-60$ not to shabby. I've been wearing timex for years and they hold up great, I'm hoping this one will do the same. I would buy another one of these watches., I'll be honest I have never liked the cheap feel and look of the G shock watches but I was looking for something that combined sport with style in all white color and this one caught my eye. Maybe I'm colorblind but all the pictures I've seen of this watch look WHITE and the main reason I bought this particular watch was because I thought it was white but it is indeed GREY not white. I set the watch up with the provided instructions and I've been wearing it all day and I like it a lot. Even though it's not white the gray colors pretty cool and it's definitely stylish and comfortable. I can't think of any downside to this watch five stars on this end!, Larger than expected., excelente, Just got this watch and it is beautiful.  I have been looking for something like this as a statement watch.  This watch  oozes confidence and polish - pulls together an outfit wonderfully.  I have only had Citizen Eco-Drives and they never disappoint.  I was just ready to update my look and this watch helped me accomplish that., I got broken one. The glass near the butterfly was broken., My brother likes it very much., Perfect!, awesome, Beautiful watch better than I expected, I have had this watch for a year and worn it almost daily, including in the shower. It still works and the strap hasn't broken. A little hard to see the dial in the dark., This came in the mail a lot sooner than i thought it would! i am very pleased with this product!! it is a very simple watch and very easy to use. It also tells you the day and the year and even counts the seconds for you with just a press of a button. It is made very well and is very comfortable. The only thing i don't like about it is that it does not stay on. You have to press the button in order to see the time. I can't wait to wear this to work! Also just another tid bit. if you do purchase this watch make sure to push the little holes out of the band so you can actually wear it. When i first tried to put on the watch it wouldn't hole and i had to firmly press out the holes to make it stay, Otherwise this is a great product. I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review., I've gotten a lot of compliments on this watch. It's beautiful and works very well., I really like the style of this watch. You're able to wear it with casual or formal clothes. I personally think the size of the watch is just fine. My old watch was just this size and I personally do not like smaller watches as I am not accustomed to them. As far as the leather band, yes it does get some used to because it is thick. I am also not too keen on the white stitching but that's just my personal taste. I will choose to replace the band when it wears out. Overall it is a stylish watch.<br /><br />The only con I don't like about it is that it chose to highlight the minutes rather than the hourly numbers. Sure you can tell from the position of the hour hand but it does take some getting used to. The minute hand and second hands are also hard to see in darkness. However I'm sure I'll get used to all of this.<br /><br />The biggest strengths of this watch are the styling, eco-drive (no need to replace the battery every year) and the Japanese movement which I hope will last., I had bought a Triumph motorcycles brand watch that looks like a TAG Heuer Monaco. The watch had a nice band but it just didn't go with the watch. The watch has a black face with red markings and the new band really accents the look. The black crocodile skin pattern and red stitching is very pleasing to the eye. The band is a little stiff but it loosens up with wear. Toscana makes a great product I highly recommend it., Bought as a gift, and the recipient was very pleased., The watch is even nicer and more attractive than pictured plus it functions wel. I'm very pleased with my purchase., A gift for a young man.  The picture was somewhat misleading as it appeared that the lid was mirrored. It is not---just clear and see through, I like the watch. I changed the strap. It was not very good. Upgraded to a better one. Make an inexpensive watch better overall., I bought one and the band broke, but I liked it do so much that I bought another one. I hope the band does not break again., PROS:<br />-clean look<br />-slim face/dial<br />-strong leather<br /><br />CONS:<br />-small loops that hold the strap are weak and fall/rip off easily<br />(had to get mine replaced on week 1), I actually really like this watch.  The only issue I'm having is that inside the face gets condensation.  Hoping it won't be on ongoing issue, since I really like it!!, Love the timer. Easy to set. Display isn't as small as some of the reviews say. In a crowded area though, you would have a hard time hearing the timer though. Plus there's no way to change the sizing of the band, at least not to my knowledge. Overall good buy for the cost. The stainless steel has a nice look to it, Thanks a lot!  beautiful!, Great watch.  Handsome and solid, if a little bulky.  I had an earlier version of this watch so when I destroyed it, I came back for another.  Only criticisim i have of this and another Bulova Marine Star model I have is that the crystal has an unbeveled edge that rises about 1/128 of an inch above the bezel and this unprotected sharp glass edge is very easy to chip if you run it into a door frame (as I often do).  Otherwise, I love the Bulova Marine Star line and they are a tremendous value., Quite a nice watch, girl friend likes it a lot, the only problem is that it's not easy to read the time, I guess she needs some time to get used to it., The watch is beautiful and very functional but the leather band could be a notch or two longer., It already broke, Great watch, fits well and the dial is nice and clear, especially with the magnified section over the date making that easy to read. The blue dial rim gives it a professional look, price was excellent., Loved these items. So shiny and sparkly.  They were exactly what I wanted ., Just like the original that flat wore out after years of service. If you're looking for a stock replacement this is as original as it gets, This s watch is too big for my taste. It is my first Nautica and truly I did not like the quality of it for the price. Is it possible to return it ??, Junk, the watch face cracked in two days, threw it in the garbage., beautiful watch, inside was dirty and is not possible clean, Like all the times watches this watch is also very good. Inexpensive for the quality,looks so classy and beautiful. Very comforatble can wear continously for hours., The face is a little smaller than expected, The only problem i have with it,  is the glass is rough around the black face trim...  I love this watch i love the brand as well. It works perfectly i also have the rose gold one so i am sold for this brand., I do not like this product cause it looks like an old one, the two watch straps worn, cannot as a present., Great classic. Have had it only a week but accurate to the minute according to atomic clock. I used a very small amount of olive oil ( a hint from my friendly cobbler ) to relax the watchband a bit and the color change was minimal. It's always nice to see the second hand purr as opposed to quartz., It looks good, and for the price It's really a good purchase. The pins that came with mine were flimsy and were also different in size. However I didn't care since I'm using my watch's original pins. My order came with a free spring bar as well., strong and durable watches,including band six,ael,tough solar,very good sports watches., Shame on Amazon - I initially could not pair the watch because it was already paired with &#34;Julie's iPhone&#34;.  I had to deleter the previous pairing in order to pair my phone with the watch.  The phone also had various information saved on it from &#34;Julie&#34;.  The watch arrived loose in the box (out of it's holder and retail box).  There was no lens protector (peel off film) that a new watch would have had.  The watch was clearly USED, not new.  Amazon is not advertising this item as used, so BEWARE!  I expected a new product, otherwise I would have ordered it from WalMart.<br />Now, about the watch - The watch works as advertised (other than having to clear someone else's data off it), and I am very happy with it's operation.  It stays paired and gives me all the notifications on my iPhone 6 (IOS 9 Beta).  Nice watch, but thanks to Amazon, I took away 2 stars.  Order this product if you want a &#34;USED&#34; watch!, Ive had this watch for a little over 8 months now and it still looks good. I usually wore it out to Vegas but now just wear it anywhere. The glass is still clear and a few scratches on the band but good. Considering I've hit around a lot. People usually ask me how much it cost and I tell them over 100 lol, Love this item. it's a quick and easy way to class up your living space. If you require or desire a small place to store your keys, loose change, collar stays, cuff links, or any small items you may accumulate in a day's work, this should fit the bill. It's a bit smaller than I imagined, and when buttoned up, it provides around 25 square inches of room for your things (5 inches per side). No complaints, though; it holds everything I need. I trust the Wolf brand, so I expect this to last me a number of years.<br /><br />As some other reviewers have suggested, this could be a great item for travelers. When unbuttoned, it can lay flat in a suitcase or bag. When buttoned up, it can make keeping track of your small items in a hotel a breeze. I may pick up another specifically for this purpose.<br /><br />Solid buy. Would buy again without hesitation., The case is small. And so the watch looks small, too.The watch works well., Listed originally at $120.00, a bit high, a real steal at $35.00 !  The world is rediscovering analog, and its' many advantages over digital.  Please note for you early Xmas shoppers, this watch comes in a really nice gift box, for gift giving., This is a great, durable watch strap. It was difficult for me to find a military-style green strap so I was happy that I came across this one on Amazon. I have a gold-rimmed Bulova dial that I use with this and they compliment each other perfectly. I don't wear a lot a flashy colors so this was my way of adding color to my wardrobe. I would definitely recommend this product., Great watch. I have been wearing this type of watch for the last 30 years. Just purchased my third one over that period of time. I work in a very hazardous environment and this watch takes it all. Like the old saying goes, &#34;It takes a licking and keeps on ticking&#34;., I like the looks of it, which is why I bought it and the functions of it., This watch its a lot better on the picture, i don't know why but i my hand i don't like, Thanks a lot!  beautiful!, I didn't like this watch at all. In fact this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. The band looked cheap and not sturdy. I felt the timepiece itself was not substantial or built in a way that I would trust for sturdiness. Completely turned off by the watch in person. Nice packaging though.<br /><br />For the same money I would buy an Invicta (which is exactly what I did), So happy to see this in 16 mm. The 19-20 works well for the men's weekender... The women's weekender needs this size to fit.  Who doesn't need a navy blue one too!, I BOUGHT THE TOOL TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES MYSELF, SO I COULD SAVE THE MONEY. AND TIME NOT GOING TO A STORE. It WORKS SO GOOD!!, I bought this because I soooo love stuffs with heart. It was delivered earlier than it should be. The chain was long, just right for me..The heart shaped clock pendant(locket) is just perfect in size.I like it.However, I gave only 4 stars because the lock was really hard to open. I almost break my nails. You can't open it with just a snap..I hope the lock was easy to open so I could check the time without hassle.<br />I got this discounted in exchange for my honest review., I like it!, looks a little cheap and plastic-ish. But gets the job done (tells time) and is water proof, Cute, Neutral so goes with a lot., I love this watch but the band was a little too stiff for me. I replaced it with a two toned silver band and I can't take my eyes off it.  It runs great and accurately. I'm seriously thinking about ordering a second one. Luv it, Luv It, Luv It.  This watch is a must buy.<br />Update<br />Bought a second one and changed the band to a two toned stainless steel band by Speidel. My first watch still looks a runs great. I have poor eye sight but the chrome hands against the black dial makes it very easy to see. I own a bunch of watches - high end and low end - this watch is my favorite !, Just received the watch today, very nice looking but a bit difficult to set up as least for me. Definitely worth the $29.99 just waiting to see how long it lasts. I will do a follow post in a couple of weeks., JUST LIKE AT THE PICTURE, This watch does deliver on its promise and was very easy to set in all of its modes.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants accuracy without the hassle., Wore this in the pool first day and bezel fogged up.  I like the style of watch and functions so going to risk a replacement and hope it works., Its perfect but i cant really tell the numbers from the lighting because is to white and bright but its nice, heavy, pretty big but i like it... not feminine look at all though, Great watch.  The face is a little bigger than I thought (I have very small wrists) but not too much.  The brushed gold color is gorgeous., I get a lot of compliments when I wear this watch.  The big face and big numbers are easy to see.  The band is a little too big for me, but I do have extremely small wrists (5.5 inches).  Something interesting about this watch is that the back of it is plastic instead of metal., Mooi horloge, goede kwaliteit voor niet te veel geld., Gorgeous watch. I catch myself staring at it all the time. Lots of compliments. I've had it for 2 weeks and it hasn't lost one minute., Love the watch the band is a darker blue than the picture, Band broke in six months. Now it is totally useless. The stitching broke where it was attached to the watch. Save you money., This thing is gorgeous all around. A show stopper. Not for every day use but very special occasions. If you want to &#34;wow&#34; the crowd, this will do. I love it. I would recommend buying from the MK store or authorize dealers like Dillard's or Macy's. It's not a Rolex but still, it's a $550, you better off knowing you getting the real deal. It's a gamble buying online. I heard some people complaining about it being cheap yellow and cheap looking, they most likely got a fake. This watch dreams quality and sophistication. The pictures don't do it justice. I totally recommend it., The band I received looked just like the pictures.  The links slightly oval and very flat.  It appears so far to be very high quality but time will tell. I had no problems putting the slide attachment into the watch.  It clicked right in and has felt very secure so far.  i will say that I probably have an average wrist and did not have to remove any links.  So if you have a larger wrist this will probably not work for you.  I did see the pictures that another purchaser posted in a review of this band and mine does not look like that.  If my opinion changes I will add to the review at a later date., Quality seems to be less than I was expecting.  Very light metal, EXCELLENT :, I really like this watch. The large numbers makes it so quick and easy to see and from someone who is largely blind it's been a huge help. A number of watches are going to this larger style face so it's of modern design. I haven't used the alarm part yet but I'm sure it will be fine. For the money it's a great product., Very good Watch,<br /><br />I recently start to work as a server so i needed a strong watch that resist every kind of hits and was resistant to water, etc. The only thing i dont like too much is when you set the time may move a little. About the rest no complains, good price though., LOVE this watch. I have &#34;dainty&#34; (okay, extremely small) wrists and struggle to find a watch that is not a child's watch, that fits me. The Velcro strap is super easy to get on and I'm able to adjust, unlike traditional bands. It was easy to program after I found the instructions on the company's website. You will need to go to their website as the box does not include instructions, but directs you there instead. Dries very quickly after being wet, which is nice., clip pin fellout in just two days. trashed it., Big watch - need a large wrist to make this watch work for you - pretty heavy as well.  But love the visibility of the dial and overall ruggedness of the watch.  Wished the band was a bit softer - but overall I would buy it again and highly recommend it., Watch so far keeping good time. Very light to wear . A little too light, feel a little cheap. But it's only a $20 watch. Had it only a month, time will tell., Solid feel, solid weight, beautiful crisp color and contrast, great price, and hopefully good for years to come.  Band is large to allow for plenty of custom lengths.  Thank you manufacturer!, beautiful watch goes well with dress and casual look. arrival in two days as promise., I received the wrong band, This watch is Huge for a woman's watch, Huge face. Looks good from far, up close its a little disappointing, Ok, Good Watch... The buttons all all difficult to operate & you have to push them multiple times...<br />You need to read the small operators manual CAREFULLY in order to set the watch up correctly...<br />The World Time does not allow you to keep both times (current time & world time city) on  the display at the same time...<br />I do like it... It's better  than my last watch..., Although I own much more expensive watches by Gucci, Movado, and Citizen, I absolutely love this watch.  It looks, feels, and operates like it costs at least 10 times more than the price!, Great watch.  Large digital letters-  easy to read., Only three buttons, making settings difficult.  Average use. Bought April 2014, died August 2015.  Hinge broke, rendering watch unwearable., This is my first automatic and I wanted something that would stand up to the crazy rain storms we had at my summer house. I also wanted something easy to see, as I do have some vision loss. This is definitely it. The Lume on this thing is incredible. Very easy to see for long periods of time. It keeps good time, too. So far it has gained +5 seconds per day. So why four stars? The wrist strap. Let me qualify this by saying that it is a beautiful strap, and if you are an &#34;average&#34; guy, you will have no issues with it. Me? I have very small wrists. So small, in fact, that sometimes a woman's watch would better suit me. Having looked at the photos on Amazon and elsewhere, I misjudged and thought the strap would have enough holes for me. It didn't. We had to punch two extra holes, and now it's a little too tight. It has gotten better, but I do think that once the factory strap goes, I will equip it with a metal one with the proper number of links removed if I can find one. Aside from the strap, this is a definite keeper. :), The face and strap are a bit skinnier/smaller than expected. If you're looking for an elegant and small &#34;women's watch,&#34; this is the watch for you. However - if you are tall (I'm 6') and consequently have big wrists, and/or prefer something with a bit more weight to it, look elsewhere. It's small enough that I can only wear it on the first or second notch, but I love the style so it's grown on me a lot., don't buy bad quality, It works pretty well, but requires a lot of elbow grease. So be prepared to rub for a while., I purchased this watch a little over a month ago and I am definitely glad I did, I like it a lot and get plenty of compliments. Can't beat the price and it keeps good time., This is a beautiful watch -- both the band and the face are exquisitely designed.  As for functionality, it is simple in its telling of time, date and day of the week.  The traditional second hand also serves as a timer in conjunction with the smaller left side timer that keeps track of minutes up to 30.  The time zone indicators can be helpful to indicate the current time of major cities; although, the text is very small and difficult to read if not seen at a good angle.<br /><br />In the hand, the watch feels heavy, and I thought for sure it would weigh down my arm once on my wrist; however, I do not notice anymore weight than with light watches.  The face of this watch is thicker than watches I have previously work.  I am concerned about scrapping it or banging it on walls, doors, etc, because of its width.  After getting the watch band shortened for free at a local jeweler, it fits snugly and nicely on my wrist.  I considered adjusting the length myself, but after watching the jeweler doing it with the unique equipment and skill I believe that was the right decision.  It only took a few minutes to get it just right.<br /><br />I believe this is an appealing watch for its appearance and use.  Its sturdy quality and water resistance also makes it good for outdoor activities.  I have received many compliments on this watch., Great watch so far. I thought the crystal got scratched but it cleaned up nicely. I wish the hands were luminous as I originally thought but no luminescence. The straps don't seem real strong hence the second one. Can't wait to see how well it does at 90 ft. down. All in all it is a very good watch for the price. So far, fully recomended., My son has been wanting a wooden watch and when he seen this on Amazon he had to have it.<br />He was so happy he went ahead and bought this piece. It is so nice and unusual. He loves the large face on it and how it looks and fits on his wrist. It looks great with any style of clothing you wear too., This is a big improvement over the band that comes with the Pebble watch.  It is strong, but soft., It does have a little bit of bling to it w a smaller face.  Great quality and looks classy, For $17, I doubt a better watch exists. I will probably buy one every year or two because it's extremely practical and it's also very comfortable., CRAP!, This is a big bold watch. Very bright and white and that is exactly what I wanted. I have received a number of complements when I wore it as it does make a statement., Broke within the first week of use, not impressed, Price is too high for the product, Unless it was a mistake, the watch I got has ALL markings on the dial in orange. The picture online has the brand name and the rest in of marks in white.<br />All marks being in orange lowers significantly the watch's appeal and appearance. It is not a bad looking piece but in my case too different to keep it., I bought this for my husband for our 5th Anniversary and its amazing and my husband loves it! The only thing is that it took 8 days too ship which sucked but it was well worth the wait!, Very small numbers and date, Love this watch. It looks similar to much higher priced watches (shinola comes to mind), but it does feel a bit cheap when handled, the metal is too light and almost plasticky adn the strap is thin and feels a bit cheap as well, but it all looks great and is comfortable. For the price, you just can't beat this watch. It does not suffer from the loud ticking that has been associated with the standard weekender, it is very quiet., I bought this band because although the pebble is waterproof, the original leather band isn't. I took a chance with only two positive reviews total and a $10 price tag, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The band fits the pebble perfectly. It looks and fits fantastic. The buckle that comes with the band is very beefy and has a nice brushed stainless steel finish that matches the watch. Very high quality stuff. The band itself is very substantial, not thin and cheap. One added bonus is that you could replace the very nice buckle with your original pebble buckle and it will fit perfectly and will give it the oem look.<br />I highly recommend this very modestly priced band.<br />Ps, I don't always write reviews. But when I do, it's because I was impressed., Excellent, Returned it. Second hand didn't line up with second tick marks. Decided to get a Mondaine automatic instead and am very happy with it. The dial also looked too large on my wrist., My life loves this watch for everyday use. Very reasonably price. would recommended., VERY nice and expensive &#34;looking&#34;.  This is 2nd one for wife.  The first one is over two years old and running fine.  Haven't lost any of the stones as some reviewers complained.  It looks like a $75 watch, and I think she paid $69.95 for the first one.  Got this one on deal of the day for $30... we've very happy., Nice watch, but it gets 4 stars since &#34;Easy-To-Read&#34; is misleading. If your looking for an easy read watch look into the Timex easy read watches. This watch is not that easy to read in low light or at all angles. I think the solar panel is to fault for this. The solar panel is under the watch face, so if you spend a lot of time outside it's, like I do, always charging.  Like others have said the band is a bit tight. To fix this put the band on something twice the size of your wrist for a couple nights to stretch it a little. My wallet did the trick. The other option is to buy a quality band, but this will run your more then the price of this watch., Love the watch but it came defective out of the box. Only buy from a reputed seller or directly from Nixon's website. Now I have to go through the lonwinded process of getting this thing returned, shipped promptly - product as advertised - thanks!, I hate it.  First of all I waited forever to get it and then they sent blue- the color of my room is red and I ordered red.  Secondly when the hands are on the part of the other lines you can not tell what time it is.  When you can see them they are not lit as in the pix they are very faint.  Finally I just made it an expensive night light for my bathroom.  Worst purchase I've made that cost over a hundred dollars.  I know I could have sent it back but I threw all the paper away before I realized it was such a dud.  Cute idea, horrible product.  L. Marie Rhyne, I've had several Casio watches with good experiences over several years. But this watch, shipped by Amazon February, 2015, has begun randomly &#34;rebooting&#34;, meaning losing its time setting and all other settings (like time zone, etc.).<br /><br />I see Amazon's return period has lapsed, so I contacted Casio tech support. The courteous Casio rep, given my explanation, said &#34;that's easy to fix -- the battery needs to be replaced&#34;. He told me this replacement can't be done just anywhere -- it has to be sent to a Casio repair center at estimated cost of $10-$30. Hmm... for a $24 watch? And I'm not sure whether that estimate included shipping charges. Casio said that a local jewelry repair shop would screw it up and void the warranty. I suspect the cost of battery replacement by Casio would exceed the price of a new watch.<br /><br />If you filter these reviews for 1 star reviews only, you'll see that lots of folks are having the exact same problem with this watch.<br /><br />If the Casio tech is right and it is a battery problem, why is my battery (and many others) failing after only 6 months? Amazon, are you shipping watches that been sitting in the warehouse for a long time, with nearly-dead batteries? If so,you are putting your customers in a bad position, receiving watches that are likely to fail shortly after Amazon's return eligibility period expires, in a way that is not covered by the Casio warranty.<br /><br />All that said, the watch itself seems pretty nice -- except that it has let me down several times, and that it expresses its need for a new battery through random, hard-to-diagnose, failures!, I like this watch, it has all the regular stuff: stopwatch, alarm, light.  This has dual time zone, compass and thermometer.  Now if you want an accurate reading you should remove from your wrist, for the thermometer.  The compass is helpful enough, you get N,S,E,W also get the degrees. The instruction were easy to follow for set up and calibration of the compass., I actually bought this as part of a Marty McFly costume. Solid and easy to use., When received was DOA. Good looking time piece but it had to work for it to be practical. Will follow up when replacement arrives, This watch is clean!!!<br />A must order it has real crystals in it and shines with and without the sun, a real eyecatcher!!, Beautiful!  A gift for my daughter., My partner and I were stressed out that we would have to replace his G-Shock watch, since it was just a band that was busted, before he went back on deployment.  His watch is very expensive. However with the replacement bands the watch works like new, without having to buy an entire new watch!, I really like this watch--I collect watches so it's getting harder and harder to impress me with one, but this is a great one. The way the band attaches to itself beyond the buckle is very handy, diving or not. In fact, while this watch was made for use in water, it's perfectly suited to anytime wear., I have had this watch for 7 years now. I have never had a problem with it. I wear it everyday and i love it so much it is the first watch i had and the best one. It is so durable, after 7 years it has one small scratch on the glass and the small thing on the strap is starting to rip. I hope it last me many more years and if tou are licky enough to find one for sale i highly recommend you buy it., Had this watch for about four months now and am really impressed. I wear this watch 5-6 days a week usually about 10-12 hours a day and it keeps perfect time. I probably wont ever buy another watch that is not powered by automatic movement. It fits comfortably and has a high quality feel. Its been in the water and shower and have never had any issues with water. A couple minor cons to this watch for me are the magnified date and the thickness of the case. I would like the looks of this watch even more if it didn't have the magnification over the date but it does make it easy to read and the case thickness is only a couple mm too large for my taste. Overall a great watch that I love wearing everyday. A smart purchase I would make again., Small on wrist, but purchased it for the old school look. Typical great Casio quality., This watch is beautiful!  Nice heavy weight, decent size without looking masculine. Very classy look for a reasonable price. Note: not all jewelers will be able to adjust the size/remove links, excellent..., Beautiful watch. It did get water in it when I went swimming on vacation, which is why I only gave it 4 stars., Gorgeous watch. I love the blue and stainless steel, classy without being flashy. Perfect size face not too big but not too small, nice weight and clasp seems fine to me., This was probably the best watch I have ever purchased. It is a very nice quality watch, and I recommend it to the fullest extent. It has so many features and options it constantly gets more interesting. The one setback though is the thermometer. It is not entirely accurate because when wearing it, knew body heat affects the reading. So if you want an accurate reading you should probably take the watch off. Other than that it is a very nice watch. I'm very pleased!, Met my need. Happy I own it..., My father thought that it was the best watch he have ever bought. I must agree that it looks really solid for it's price., The watch is very pretty. I have a very small wrist, so the watch's face looks very large on my wrist. At first it felt a little heavy, but I don't wear watches to often., This is an all around inexpensive yet capable, not gawdy, watch that has all,of the features I look for in a watch. It is both analog and digital, waterproof( I regularly dive to 100ft with mine), illuminated, and it has an alarm. At only around $30, there is a huge amount of value in this sharp little watch. I highly recommend it for daily use., Battery went out no one will replace, Pretty, but came with DEAD BATTERY., Purchased for The Wife, who had trouble seeing the numbers (numbers appeared clear, but orange glow from the back lighting did not agree with her - she says it gave her headaches). She passed it along to our son, who was able to use it., Only gave it one star because I coulnt leave a big fat zero., Nice watch, watch bracelet strap seems too large for the watch and was very stiff., Self-winding is not for me...and this watch is a little too large and masculine., I am pleased with my watch.  The price was less than half the jewelry store cost., Extremely gorgeous and runs very precisely, This watch was just what I needed to track time in a dark room without being conspicuous. Good large face and good price. Band runs large. and doesn't have a shiny finish to it. All in all, and for the price, I thought this a satisfactory purchase. The watch came packaged in a small cardboard box without any protection, but arrived unharmed.THEN I wore it to the function it was specifically purchased for. This watch does NOT keep good time. I have now placed two new batteries in the watch, yet, it failed me yesterday at an event--October 17, 2015., I like the watch but after two months the battery died., Wow what a stunner!!!, It's just what I was looking for. It has a basic dial but very nice detail that can only really be seen up close, when you're actually holding it. It's simple, but has a touch of elegance and it looks and feels great., Very nice watch. Be aware that is a chunky watch, and a heavy watch which surprised me, and more so than similar watches. But this is not a worry on my wrist and it has a nice look about it. Keeps excellent time. The date display is large which is one of the reasons I chose this watch. Good quality and feel. Very happy with this purchase and hats off to Amazon for delivery to my door in Perth Western Australia in 6 days!  great stuff!, Great watch for a registered nurse.  Military time.  Easy date display. Second hand for counting heart rates and respiration rates.  Washes easily under the sink while wearing.  Solid!, It is brighter than expected. I was expecting a black mate color instead I got a black shine color, Pros: still the stylish watch out right now<br />  For its features battery last all day so that's a plus.<br />  Supports most major apps<br />  It's different from most watches interface, I had the pebble,time.<br />  Right screen size, doesn't feel too big<br />  Fast, it never lags at anything it does.<br />  Customizable, there are a lot of watch faces and the new interactive faces you can add to make it stand out more, and new always on feature.<br />  $150 is a great price.<br />  Wifi included with new update<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Overall battery isn't impressive compared to other basic watches that does less.<br />  With its slim design it's hard to stand out with watch skins, like slickwraps have a few but the Bezzle is really slim.<br />  For most women this would be too big, Everything was perfect, didn't work, very beautiful and fancier than i expected. very satisfied., Looks nice. Fits watch. Clasp doesn't stay fastened and several times a day I have to stop the watch from falling off. Too bad, I really liked it and planned on buying a black one. I've gone back to my G-Shock., Awesome watch for the price nice big face everyone gkeeps asking about it, Item arrived with crack in glass and no battery. Tells time correctly twice a day. Not worth sending back., Yay, I purchased this unit over 5 months ago.  It has been running everyday on the bedroom dresser ... with the blue LED turned off (it is VERY bright at night).  So far, this has worked perfectly and it is completely silent.  This was definitely a good purchase., When I saw this watch online the design grabbed my attention. When I got the watch and saw it in person I loved it even more. The watch has a very expensive look and feel, its heavy and a great conversation piece. I however had some difficulties figuring out how to secure the watch on my hand as it was the first coming across one such as this. after some time i finally figured it out. The only drawback was that I thought the leather band would have a richer luster to it. But overall this a great watch and i do not have any regrets making the purchase., Awesome watch but not for big wrist, Excellent! Beautiful. Citizen makes high quality well built watches. I own others and they are bullet proof. I torture test them all... Salt water swimming, steam rooms, sauna, hot tubs... No scratches, no missed seconds...they are good. This one especially is nice to look at., I purchased this watch through another source (Touch of Modern).  I have several metal watches, but this is my first Andrew Marc, and my first self-winding automatic.<br /><br />Quality is first rate.  The band is solid and thick.  It feels like my Bulova more than my Seiko.  Visually it's very appealing, and the quality seems excellent.  I've already gotten compliments on it at work.<br /><br />The band is a bit large.  I had to remove 3-4 links to get it to fit my wrist., i like the look but have trouble latching the clasp., I love this watch. The beautiful simplicity, just the right touch of gold contrast & diamond markers. Absolutely chic, understated elegance., Plenty of supplies for future needs  :), People talking about battery life on this smart watch. Well mine has been off the charger for over 24 hours and still have 24% battery life left. It's a great watch., Picture doesn't do it justice !, I have lots of watches, but end up wearing this one the most. I had one like it when I was much younger. I was tickled to find it again, and with the lovely metal band. It's comfy and even dressy, and just plain cool. The BEST thing about it is the countdown timer. VERY helpful tool, and I use it throughout every day. It's faster to use than your phone. It also has date and stopwatch. I've worn it in the pool and friends worry that it gets wet. They think it was expensive. Every woman needs one of these watches ;), Alright, I love this watch.<br /><br />I'm a 33 year old guy. I dress in a casual way, but I try to wear meaningful clothes -- even t-shirts are carefully selected or vintage. If I'm not going to wear a suit and tie all the time, I at least need to rock the casual stuff properly.<br /><br />This watch is absolutely classic. The sandalwood face is large enough to stand out and subtle enough to look smooth. I'm pretty familiar with all different types of wood, having made furniture and musical instruments in the past, and I know how hard it is to get sandalwood to a smooth finish that doesn't expose porous grain. The sandalwood face is grain-filled well and looks perfect.<br /><br />I also like that there are only hour/minute hands, no second hand. Honestly, if I'm going to time something to the second, I'll use the phone in my pocket. A wristwatch just needs to look great and give me an accurate time reading.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the watch didn't come with any paperwork or instructions. Setting the time is easy enough -- you pop the knob out, twist it and push it back in, like so many other watches -- but it's always nice to see a warranty or contact information. I'd take this to a jeweler to have the battery replaced, though it would've been nice to have a piece of paper with contact info, battery info, whether there's any water resistance, etc.<br /><br />The watch itself is great and the R/W/B band is sharp. It'll take a little time to break in, but the watch is very comfortable and my girlfriend thinks it looks fantastic (and she's a tough critic on accessories).<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, which I've tried to provide here (check my other reviews, they aren't all positive!). I'm very impressed with this Woodies watch and I will absolutely look for more. Kiiiinda got my eye on the ebony watch!, This was my first Nixon watch, and overall it's a decent piece. The quality is decent, although not great for the price. The blue seemed very attractive to me, and it doesn't stick out too much. I do wish the case was larger., You can pick these up for about half of what this company is charging., Cheap quality. Small then appears on picture, This is a really nice boyfriend watch that isn't too bulky. The face of the watch is more on the thin side and sits really well on the wrist. I went to a local jeweler to have them remove two links. I love the simplicity of it. It is a mixture of matte and shiny silver. I get compliments when I wear it, and it pairs nicely with bracelets. This watch is exactly what I was looking for in a boyfriend type piece., Excellent!, I love the owl itself as a decoration but the watch does not work well....it works...then stops...then works again.  If you need it for use as a watch...forget it.  With the wings closed it is a very pretty key ring., nice watch, band a little cheesy but it's to be expected for the price. Overall good purchase, It's very pretty, I get a lot of compliments. It's also comfy and a tiny bit smaller than I thought it would be, but it doesn't mean I don't like it. The only issue with it is IT TICKS LOUD AF. My boyfriend makes me put it in a drawer at night lol. I'm used to it but yeah, it can be a pain., Very bad item , water enter inside watch, This is a good tool to replace the back on watches with smaller faces. The new watches with the larger faces, the biggest piece will not work.I have a few watches that this will not work on. Maybe I have to buy bigger press pieces to go with this set but haven't look., Purchased this item and received a cheap necklace instead... Not happy., It's awesome 😍😍, velcro doesnt last long..., I like it, Nice case to keep watches organized. It's a pretty sturdy construction. My only gripe with it is the latch mechanism. The release button on the latch feels a little sticky sometimes when I open up the case. The lock on the latch is very basic, you could manipulate it with a paper clip or similar., light sucks. and if you barely touch the dial on the side it will change your stuff, there isn't a lock, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096LP1C6?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0, MY son like, Thanks a lot!  beautiful watch!, Excellent watch, big digits, it maybe look complicated but once you read the instructions you’ll find it very easy to be operated. Decent size, light weight., It was a hit!!gabe as a birthday gift to daughter,she wears it most days, Very beatiful watch,it is suitable for those who have small wristhand., The watch arrives in good shape. Nice leather bracelet. Fashionable. I get compliments each time I wear it. Definitely a must-have!!, This caught my eye  at Macy's  but  Amazon  beat their price by a couple of hundred dollsrs.  This is my 4th  Victorinox , and I love them all., stopped working, Great-looking lots however it was shipped with a dead battery, Nice watch. The only thing I don't like is the little bands that hold down the main band are a bit difficult to use., Great watch pretty easy to use if you read instructions comfortable tom wear looks like it will stand a knock, Igot this as a gift and it is even better in real life. Good quality also, I started to use only gold color watch. I like it. It looks very stylish like expensive watchers. Nobody can say how inexpensive they are.<br />I have to resize the braslet - did not do it yet., This watch is bought for my sister. The color is stunning!!!She's super satisfied with it, Cute but not very comfortable, Way too big for a woman's watch... I would have returned it but I will try to trade it for a lady lamb (sheep) once I am back in Mexico..., Lg watch urbane and I wish I could upload a photo. Sweeeeeeeet band., HAD TO RETURN THE WATCH,DUE TO THE LINK ON THE BAND FELL OFF., Fantastic watch.  You can see a full review on YouTube if you check out the mainspringreviews channel., Edges easily get dirty., excellent, Very nice and rugged watch for the price.  I get lots of comments and inquiries about my watch.  I have not really gotten it too wet or dirty so I don't really know how it will hold up on that end, but I would definitely recommend this watch.  Great quality for a small price., I bought one of these bad boys and modified into a belt! Now everyone can just look at my crotch to see what time it is., the item not like image. every, Nice watch but if you don't wear it one day then the auto wind is not good enough to keep it running and you have to reset the time., I was a little disappointed...it arrived with noticeable scratch on the face. Other than than that, arrived on time & it works fine., Delivery OK and Excellent Product. Thank you., Good everyday watch.  Simple and easy to read. I like that I don't have to drag my cell phone out of my purse to check the time!, Nice looking watch, perfect size, but ticks kind of loud, We bought two of these watches for our identical twin girls.  We bought them for the vibrating quality (we wanted a gentle way to wake our children). We also needed a watch that was small enough for their wrist and this watch seemed to fit the bill.  We bought one watch for one of the girls, she loved it so we bought a second one for the other about a month later.  The first watch worked for a about two months  and the second watch broke within a few weeks.  The first watch worked until one day it just continued to vibrate non-stop and light all the functions at once on the screen--the buttons were unresponsive. The second watch worked for about a week or so, but  the watch didn't seem to alarm at the times programmed. It was always off by some amount--10 minutes, 20 minutes, etc...we assumed it was our daughter setting it wrong, or perhaps accidentally resetting it by pressing buttons while sleeping...however, it never worked properly (even when we set it for her) and eventually the buttons also became unresponsive like the other one.  I contacted the manufacturer after 4 months and the rep said, &#34;Well, did you change the battery?  Most likely in both cases it  is because the battery is not powerful enough.  The watch will do respond oddly when the battery needs to be changed.&#34;  However, that doesn't really make sense since for the one watch with the battery in it still vibrates with full force.  She suggested I send it back to her at our expense and they would either replace the battery at no charge or fix it and send it back at to us at no charge.  Oh, and she also mentioned that the batteries only last about 2 months in this watch since the vibration uses a lot of battery power.  So be prepared to spend money on extra batteries.  I also called Amazon and they said that my 30 days had expired, but they would allow me to return them anyway--with a restocking fee of 20% (which was about $15).  Thanks for good customer service Amazon!  &#60;smile&#62;  I also called the Amazon provided watch warranty people and they sent us UPS mailing labels. We were told to return each of them in separate boxes with the labels provided. It would take 5-8 weeks to get the watches either repaired or replaced.  They would update us via email during the process.  We opted to send for &#34;repair&#34; through the Amazon Watch Warranty people-- not sure if that was the right decision or not. Will try to update after repair. It comes with a 2 year warranty via Amazon--so we'll see how it goes.  Update: Sept 16 2015  Was told by repair service that the part needed is no longer made.  So they opted instead to refund my full purchase price via an Amazon gift card. I was told the same thing for BOTH watches.   This ended up being the best option. We got our full money back.  We are going to buy the our children a LIGHT based alarm clock instead., It works, but its not a true NATO watch. No third ring and the band is super stiff. If you are looking for a good NATO watch go for somehting else.<br /><br />Like I said. This work fine, but it is stiff and needs to break in over a week.<br /><br />Fits my OG Pebble nicely., I wear this watch every day. I thought I would buy it to wear every now and again but I love it so much I never take it off! It is comfortable and light. I mat buy another one just in case I ever misplace or lose this one!, The look is ok, Gold on gold face makes it hard to read. The watch slips on my wrist and ends up on the palm side of my arm. Sorry I bought it, Little small and didn't cover my tattoo very well (which is why I wanted it) but it looks really cute., I love this watch! Backlight is a very unique aqua/blueish color (looks much better in person than photo).  Very well made, much more solid than my Casio which cost more.  Purchased from Fly88, and when there was a minor issue they sent an immediate replacement with no hassle., it was everything I expected it to be., It works. But for today's technology, the watch is a little overpriced. Those functions the watch offers are available for over 20 years. Com'n, Casio. Are you selling this like an antique?, Had this wathc for 4months now and I love it... I got so many compliments about the watch saying its really nice and good looking....<br />The quality is really good for it's price... It doesn't feel cheap...It was a bit heavy which is I like the most...<br />Will buy another Elina Baroka's watch..., A bit pricey, but I love the large numbers so I would consider it fair., Terrible quality watches. Not even worth my comment, The watch is beautiful and arrived two days earlier than expected.  The only negative is the fact that it is a grey market new watch and not covered by the regular Tissot warranty, but that was disclosed by the seller and shouldn't be a big deal for a watch of this caliber., For that much money it scratches very easy seems cheap but wasn't the red one is 25 bucks cheaper and it's the same jus doesn't say windy city oh well if price was 20 or under 5 star, I love it! I'm a teacher and my students think it's pretty cool. I think the rhinestones make it look cheap--I would have preferred one without the rhinestones. But hey, it's just for fun, and it *WAS* cheap, so it's all good., Nice watch, did not like the stiff bracelet. It didn't feel right on my wrist. Had to send back., I have had the watch now for only a week but so far I'm very satisfied.The only problem I have is that the watch came without an instruction manual and directs you  to the website to download a  manual But when I have gone to do so the manual does not download so I've had to figure it out by trial  and error and have had no luck  figuring out the compass. This was  the primary reason for buying this  model so this is a problem.This watch replaces a Precision 2 0 which I liked very much so I'm hoping to be able to learn how to use the compass or if not I'd be happier with the Precion 2.0. I'll update upon learning how to use the other features, Very nice looking watch at the right price. I am very satisfied with it, so much so that I got one in black and one in blue. Simply awesome., This is exactly the type of watch I've been after.  Aesthetically pleasing, durable and immediately useful.  All watch lovers should have a G Shock in their collection., Just received this today, and this piece is beautiful love the blue on this watch., A very nice everyday watch. Easy to read dial, high quality. If you're looking for a rugged, attractive watch at a very good price, this is for you., 2.5 years later. Still happy with it. I’m hard on it so due to my job (plumber). Going to need to replace the band at some point but they are cheap for this model. It seems like the hands always block the the date which is really annoying. I’ve purchased a second G-Shock to wear on weekends. In summary, I’m happy with this purchase and I would buy it again., Three 1/2 weeks into wearing it everyday, the leather started to wear off. But I didn't mind b/c it added that worn out feel to it, which I liked. My problem was the second hand fall off and the watch no longer function properly. I got a lot of compliments and I did like the style. The middle beaded bans did not stay in place. Not sure if that was intentional with the style but it was annoying. I have a small wrist and it fitted okay. I would have liked it better if the strap holder was adjustable so when I set the hole to the last setting (yes, that's how small my wrist is) the end part was not dangling. If the second hand didn't fall off in less than a month, I would have given it a 4 stars. Sorry, Time100, I had to return the watch., I loved this watch until today when I noticed the second hand has fallen off. I'm so disappointed and now trying to figure out how to have it repaired or replaced by momentum., Just what I need, I have had this watch for over a year an the problems I met were. Friction tab on bracelet clasp broke, it needs regulation -30s/day, ratchet wheel is for a change for broken teeth, screw down tube or crown need replacement. Other that that, cute watch and good presence, but add some more money to the asking price, The watch turned to a terrible color, I got this watch a couple of yrs back and I've loved it since then. I really like the combination of the dial's face and it's outer border. The inner dial looks like a muted/ slightly textured silver color and the overall area and numbers are a good size and easy to read. The dial's border is beautiful. It's a mirror border and it appears to be really unique.The stones however, don't really shine as much.<br /><br />It worked pretty well for 2 yrs and recently stopped working... perhaps needs a batter change. Overall, I really like this watch. I didn't have any issues with the strap but then again, I have a relatively smaller wrist and hence strap didn't require expanding on the wrist., I wear this pretty much all day long...and this is the only watch I wear. Although I have fancier ones, this is so comfortable and convenient. The best thing I like about the Timex is that the glass window is recessed and so doesn't get scratched. For that alone, I'll keep buying these again and again.The light button is not at a convenient point.... would have preferred a swap with the start/split button. Waiting for a deal., It is wonderful!, I have been on a Quest for a Quality Diver watch under $250. I have ordered and returned 5 watches. Brands like Jiusko, Swiss Eagle, Swiss Legend, and Sturhling. All of those are good brands but non was exactly what I was looking for until I got this Invicta. Some where defective and others felt like a lesser quality. The Sapphire glass on the Jiusko was paper thin. The crown fell off the Sturhling and the Swiss Eagle decorative trim came loose under the crystal. I knew when I held this watch that it was quality. The watch looks better in person because the picture doesn't even do the carbon fiber justice. The stainless steel band is a high quality. It is a great watch for smaller wrist like mine. You can also micro adjust the band with the locking mechanism. It has 5 different settings.  The automatic sweeping second hand is my favorite feature. The colors are vibrant but not gody. The screw down crown and uni bezel works perfect. It also has a partial glass exhibition screw down back. The two tone stainless steel is also very attractive and expensive looking. The watch would be perfect if it had three things. Sapphire Crystal. I would gladly pay over $200. A thinner case..it's a touch big. And a flat glass surface. The crystal has a manifyer for the date and looks like it is glued instead of a seamless crystal. I am comparing it to a Rolex or Omega and clearly this is not. This is my first Invicta and won't be my last. Good Job guys for making a quality product at a reasonable price!  Update: after a few days the watch is running 15 mins fast. I am going to keep an eye on it. I might return it if it doesn't keep good time. After all what's the point of a nice watch if you can't count on it to tell you the accurate time!, I love this watch! It's been getting majority of my wrist time since I got it. The lume on the watch is amazing. I work in a fairly well lit office in a warehouse, which is decently lit. When I leave my office and step into the warehouse, I see my watch glowing. It's even more noticeable when the watch gets direct sunlight. The face is easy to read and the band is decent. The clasp feels a bit cheap, but definitely not a deal breaker. I have larger wrists that measures around 8 inches. The watch fit right out of the box with out any adjustments., Construction looks to be of high quality. Pillows for the winder are to small to effectively and securely hold my watches in place while in motion. Since there are three static pillows, Some variability in sizing would have been helpful.  Update; 3 months in the motor squeaks terribly. Sent a note to the vendor shining image. No response! Contact Amazon, they are thankfully standing behind it., This clock does not work.<br />i want to replace it<br />needles do not work, Lovely watch but two rhinestones have fallen out. I have probably worn it 10-12 times. Won't wear any more and probably to late to return., I love it! It is very cute and band is good quality. The face is big, but I knew that based on the pictures when I ordered. It is easy to read and even fits my very small wrist. I have received several compliments on it. My only disappointment is that I paid $34 and it is now $22..., Very good and easy to use and fast shipping, This is just a good looking watch, I purchased it from Amazon because they had the best price, and I wanted a solar watch., Loved it, highly recommended, The watch arrived on time in new condition. At first I was impressed with the watch (but not the band though - more on that below). The watch has some impressive features such as the excellent nighttime luminescence (almost as good as the Luminox watch I used to own). The second hand moves in a continuous sweep motion and the hour and minute hands line up with the numbers perfectly. The band was too short to wear comfortably on my wrist (which is an average size for a 6-foot tall man) but other than being too short for me the band appears to be made from very high quality leather.  Having said all that, this mechanical watch is supposed to stay &#34;charged&#34; for 42 hours when not being worn and mine never made it longer than 16 to 18 hours without stopping. It also failed miserably to accurately keep time and compared to the USNO atomic clock signal it gained more than 30 seconds per day (difficult to say precisely how much though because it never actually made it an entire day without stopping). After Hamilton confirmed that they only directly provide warranty support if the watch is purchased through one of their authorized dealers I chose to return this defective watch for a refund.  Lastly, but this is a minor point since decent watch bands can be obtained elsewhere at a reasonable price, the color of the band on my watch was a lighter shade than what is shown in the product picture and the color didn't seem to match the black color watch face very well. I did not like the band., The 6900 is really all about style, so I think this colorway exemplifies the streetwear rep this model has. I love how the design permeates through the layers of the watch, even to the LCD. Matte finish is silky smooth, unique., The watch looks really good, however it is very dim. It's really hard to see the time, and I cannot change the time. It comes with a manual, that isn't even for this watch..I'm starting to think I bought a fake one. I'm not happy with my purchase.  :(, Update on 10/6  Over a month passed, since my purchase. The watch still runs reliable without an issue. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Update on 9/13  After returning my first purchase, I was not able to find another watch that looks as good under $500. So, I decided to give it 2nd try, thinking that I could return it if it did not work out. It turned out to be a good decision and, after 11 days, the watch is running strong.  Now, my takes on this watch.  First, the look is great, which is the main reason that I came back. It mimics Rolex Datejust design, a very classic look. I love the bezel and the jubilee bracelet, which make the watch really stand out. The black dial and silver hands & bezel are very classy combination and bring up contrast. The markers look very sharp, particularly under good lighting, even though I am not sure of the their materials. And, for $150, it comes with a Sapphire crystal.  Secondly, the movement has been running strong so far. Like the last one, it runs averagely 8 seconds faster per day, in the past 11 days. I am very pleased with that.  The only thing that I'd recommend improvement is the bracelet. It is not bad at all, just does not look as good as the watch case.  Given all these facts and its amazing price, I give this watch a 5 star review. It beats a lot watches under $500.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The watch ran +8 seconds per day for the first 3 days. Then on the 4th day, it stopped, even if I hand-winded it. It was a very good-looking watch and I liked it very much, but I had to return it. Given the failure, I did not even bother to exchange.  I left 2 stars, one for the look of the watch and the other for hope that mine was just an outlier.  BTW, the return service of Amazon is excellent. Truely hassle free., Excellent, The longer I have this watch, the more I like it.  It seems to be just as accurate as my quartz watches, and the rotor is completely silent (unlike some automatics).  The watch is very comfortable on the wrist.  Beautiful quality!  You get a lot for money: Manual winding as well as automatic winding is a huge bonus as you don't have to use a watch winder to keep it wound.  You also get hacking, sapphire crystal, date complication, solid links on the band. Perfect!  My only complaint against the watch is that the box that it comes in is very cheap looking, but I really don't care about the box.  Seiko obviously put the money in the watch, not the presentation, and that's fine with me., This watch is very classical looking and suitable for any occasions., My hubby likes it, but the metal back caused his wrist to break out in a rash but he will give it another try and if that happens again I will update this post., High quality product., This watch is pretty big, but I after awhile I got use to it and so far people has been complimenting me on it. Overall it's a nice watch., Had the watch for 1 week and the band broke, My daughter wore her watch to school twice and the minute numbers are already coming off. Very disappointed with this watch. I passed up many other watches because they did not have the minute numbers. Had I known this would have happened I definitely would not have bought this watch., Definitely a great purchase. It is so helpful having a watch that has basically the perfect time. The quiet beep every hour really helps staying focused if you are working or studying. The best part of the watch though has to be the coloring, I love how it subtly changes colors depending on the lighting., I have an older Casio model SGW-100B that came with the nylon band. I use this watch for backpacking and other extended outdoor activities and the nylon band gets really funky so I wanted a rubber one. I have searched far and wide until I found this one. It doesn't fit perfectly but with some effort I was able to force the pins on and it's great now. For some reason Casio made this band different from almost every other watch there is as far as how the band attaches so you can't just buy any aftermarket one for it., Smaller than I believed it would be, but works properly., This watch is for the bold.  It will take any business casual outfit to the next level; however, it can be worn well with anything.  The watch is big and heavy but not obnoxiously so.  I work out as much as possible so I have the physique to match the watch 5%.  I have promoted Invicta watches to my peers at work so we can all step up our watch game., It's okay with the price., It is not water-resistant despite what the packaging says. I had to have it replaced because i went swimming with it, and the second they sent still collects water inside it. Regardless, the watch is beautiful and very elegant., Excellent quality and size! Fitted perfectly my, Perfect watch for a nurse., Check the size of the product. This is pretty small. If you want small, you will like it. Good construction., Item came quickly and well packed. Love the finishing -matte- and how easy it's to apply on the wall. We're happy with the size, it looks fine. It's just what we wanted for my daughter's bedroom ! She loves it !, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  The band doesn't wrap correctly and the diamonds are only decals that are glued to the strap.  Very cheaply made., The strap on this broke after a week! The mild bending of putting on and taking off the watch caused it to break after literally less than 7 days, ridiculous! Otherwise the watch seems fine and looks good. Now I need to see if I can find a replacement strap that won't break so frickin quickly..., Nice watch.  Suggest changing the stock rubber watchband with something better. Waterproof leather or even a NATO looks a bit more distinguished and gives the watch more character., It is an elegant watch.  For my small wrist it is a little heavy for every day use.  But it is great for special occasions., As advertised. Works perfectly and doesn't make any noise., It's a beautiful watch. It's just that it runs small for a medium to large wrist, and the catch won't close., excellent, The watch band was the wright band after I order the wrong one the first time but had no problem exchanging it Thank You Amazon, Awesome watch. I love it. People ask me where and when did I get it. I tell them Riga, Latvia. Fast and well worth the money. Ordering more of this brand soon. Seller rocks., Blue face on dark metal is a great look. Have worn it for several years as my everyday watch, to include outdoor activities and office work. Takes a beating, but has some character to it., Unfortunately the website will not update the watch so we are returning it - can't even get the first football season schedule., I have had this watch for several years now. I am a very active grown women. This watch is perfect for a small wrist-ed (about 6&#34;) women. I have only changed the battery once. I have swum in the Gulf of Mexico, did 30ft+ drops into the bayou with it, gardening, hiking, camping, etc. It's very tough, and the band has held up wonderfully, only starting to show its age this last year. Recently it has begun losing minutes every night. After searching the stores and online for a replacement watch I was sooo happy to be able to find the same watch on Amazon. It's definitely not just for kids!, One of the best prices for the rangeman, and I am a fan of negative displays. Very fast module, accurate., Definitely what I expected.  Authentic Nixon watch.<br />Will soon buy another color from them., Its does not look like the pics at all, its not even working,looking cheap and rust, I am returning it immediately., Looks quite nice but doesn't even stay wound over night. Too much hassle to set the time every single day. I also suspect the leather band won't last  all that long. So, I returned it.<br /><br />I also own the Armitron Men's 20/4768BISV Stainless Steel Automatic Watch and like it a whole lot more. It stays wound for a whole weekend and has a durable metal watch band. I've been using it for 10 months and it's my go to watch now. Only complaint is that there is not enough color contrast between the watch hands and the background gears. But, not a huge issue for me., The band is awesome and great! I love it. I just wish there were more notches because I have a tiny wrist and the extra notch would make it fit better. But other than that, it's a good band, This is a great genuine leather replacement watchband. I needed a 27mm but this 26mm was just fine. The hasp is a matte black. Good quality and price ($25)., I would have given it 5 stars but the band is too small. I have average sized wrists (8&#34;) and I can barely use the last hole in the band. I had to buy a longer band. The watch is great., Me gusta., My teenage daughter loves the color of this watch. It's such a beautiful blue-ish green color. They call it green, but it's more of a sea-foam green. The band is comfortable to wear and uses a buckle closure so it fits just about any write size. It has stopwatch features and an indeglo light for being able to view the time in the dark. And we've found it most certainly is waterproof, as it's been worn accidentally when taking a shower. But the color, that's makes it so nice. The sea-foam color is beautiful!, Very attractive and made a nice gift.<br /><br />Very affordable, but kind of inexpensive in a &#34;don't expect this to work really well&#34; kind of way.<br /><br />Would probably decide to spend a bit more for a higher quality device next time., defective, This is my third watch of this brand. Such a good quality and design, I always ask myself how they can be that cheep. Shipment was fast and item was safely packed., I love the look and the fit. I could not select a better item., beautiful watch.  bought as a gift and he wears it every day.  he receives daily compliments.  perfect size on wrist, no water resistant very unhappy with this watch it was a gift for my mother in her bday! :/, junky broke very soon pretty though, I love it! As a Gshock fan I just wanted a really cool black one... This one is perfect. As for visibility, stop trying to read your watch in the dark! Haha. Great watch! Gshock is the best, I like the simplicity, but the sharp look of this watch. It arrived exactly as pictured: brown band, white face, rose gold. My only disappointment is the quality of the band. It is nowhere near as thick as the black band that's on my other Bulova watch., Cute watch which comes w/extra battery.  Just a fun watch., Stopped working after three days.. The knob on the right stopped turning so I couldn't reset the time. Top and bottom knobs do nothing. Looks good and feels nice but spend your $15 on something else., This is a beautiful watch. I wanted a watch with large case and I had three links removed from the bracelet.  Its very fashionable !, I got this watch for one purpose, and that was for counting down to the starting signal of sailboat races where timing is crucial. It's great for that. The countdown time can be set in minutes, e.g. 4 minutes, and then when you see/hear the warning signal you start it. But wait, there's more. If you're slow starting it, you still go ahead and start it and when you see the preparatory signal you hit a button to calibrate it (i.e. the time will drop down to the nearest minute, so e.g. if your watch says 3:10 on it because you were 10 seconds late starting it it becomes 3:00 after pressing the button). But there's even one more great feature, the watch will beep at every minute mark counting down, and then under a minute to go every 10 seconds, and at 10 seconds to go every second. In summary, the watch is great for allowing you to focus on sailing and getting a good start while keeping you aware of the time to the start. Now would I get this watch to wear out on the town? No, but it's a sports watch, that's not it's purpose. It's not exactly bad looking though, for a sports watch. I can't comment on the countdown if you're setting it above 10 minutes, I think you can only set it in 5 minute intervals then and I'm not sure how often it beeps., Honestly it's super cute but the strings for adjustments are too long, it was delivered and didn't work, and it smelled like cat pee...ew., Unfortunately, the watch is too big.  The picture made the size of the watch look similar to other watches.  I had previously purchased an XOXO watch with a leather (buckle up) band.  I am 72 years old and short (5'1&#34;).  I am contemplating returning the watch and getting a similar watch of an appropriate size.  If I decide to keep it, I will have to remove a link and the instructions were not that clear.  It appears as if I have to buy a piece to take the link off or perhaps just use a very small screwdriver., Beautiful watch, seems to be pretty sturdy and smooth in its operations., Awsome, Much larger then it appeared to be on line., Great looking watch!  I have a rather large wrist and was pleasantly surprised to find the band long enough, which is not always the case.  Some of the operation instructions are a bit difficult - like how to change the date only.  But love the orange leather band and black face - very easy to read.  Lots of compliments already on the look of the watch.  I highly recommend it., Everything perfect..., Awesome watch.  Very fast service, For the price, I can't complain.  The watch does look and feel inexpensive.  My biggest concern is that the stem does not screw in.  The instructions are for several models, some that screw in and some that don't.  I'm concerned that the watch may leak while diving but so far so good after about 3 dives.  (The manufacturer cautions that the dive is not designed for diving, but why rate it at great depth if not for diving?), This is a great product. The diameter of the watch is a bit on the small side. I would buy more if it came in different color bands., This watch has a very cheap band, veramente fantastico .grazie, Amazing!! The pictures don't do it justice., The lady likes it, and really that is all that matters.., Excellent product. Cute design. Classy look, It's been several months since I've purchased this and it's still in quality condition. It's very flat, which is excellent because it's subtle and not bulky-looking. I have gotten lots of compliments, more than any other watch I've owned. The subtle details of this watch draws people in closer to examine the aesthetic quality., Bought it to overlap a larger basketball pendant. Although small, which I wanted, it is clearly visible as a medic alert. My only issue is that it has a tendency to flip over the other pendant therefore not visible. Plan to sauter them together., Thin and feels a little cheap., I love it. fit nicely on my bonny wrist. Not big and still easy to read. I love the product. 10 years warrant from the date of purchase (this card included in the box)., Love it! It goes with everything and is amazing quality to that price!, Battery ran out very fast, but it was so cheap it was ok, The watch didn't indicate of the manufacturing location. After one month of usage, moisture was seen under the glass screen. This watch is like a fake to lure people from buying with a high price. What's the point of 75% to 80%+ discount with the final price is still more than 100$. This is a fraud and I strongly recommend NOT TO BUY this s***., Absolutely love this watch. Stylish, fitting for casual and better.  Excellent quality, keeps good time. Very pretty, and just the right size dial for my wrist.  Easy to read., Long proven design, what else is there to say?, This Band is simply amazing it is build with premium material and it works with the 1st pebble but make sure to get it shortend<br />This is the way to go, Used this to fit my Moto360 android watch and it fits perfectly. My only problem is getting the links out adjust the band to fit my wrist and it took some getting use to because the band would pull the hairs on my arm but the band is off good quality and worth every penny, as a matter of fact I did not receive the correct product.  the product i received only had the spring bar remover on it and not the link pin remover.  had to struggle using a paper clip to remove the link pins.  too much trouble to return a $5.50 item to mainland China., outstanding, Too big, I'll need to get at least 4 if not 5 links removed, It makes the most annoying clicking sound when it's winding. I can't sleep with it. I barely stand listening to it, even when I'm not trying to fall asleep., Awesome colors!! I really like it! Nice watch for a cheap price! Thanks. I paid a little more to buy from a seller that is actually located in the USA, so I received it quick. I definitely recommend this seller & the watch., After a day of use, I wouldn't recommend this watch. The bracelet links have a sharpish edge to them, and is not comfortable for long wear times. The chronometer is also pretty s***. When i reset mine, it overshoots the \\\\\"zero\\\\\", so it ends up behind where it's supposed to be. The bracelet is also not securely attached to the watch, mine is already bending after a day of use.    Aside from that, it looks nice for the price, but he above consideration make it not worth the meager price, and I just wish I had found this watch face from another manufacturer. Don't think I'll ever get another Megir or tell anybody I know anything good about them., Broke within 2 days., For the price it's ok. Cheaply made, Two thumbs up, Beutiful watch, perfect gift!, i received correct watch and was credited for shipping paid plus additional amount.  Thank you., I was pleasantly surprised when my watch showed up.  I was looking for a digital that I could read at night. This is the one.  Watch is not small and even though I have a larger wrist, I had to adjust the band to its smallest setting.  GREAT watch for the price!, I would've preferred that the hands were more luminescent.......it has a &#34;backlight&#34; but you have to depress the stem to activate it.  Other than that, its well worth the price., [[ASIN:B00F5QYLRC La Mer Collections Women's LMCLIFTON003 Stainless Steel Watch with Wraparound Brown Leather Band and Chains]] this is way better than, even though the La Mer is double the price. La Mer watch broke in just a couple of weeks and is worthless., Somewhat disappointed in accuracy of this self-winding watch, I was able to open all the watch backs I have tried so far. Saves me tons of money replacing watch batteries for my whole family. Highly recommended., This polish works wonderfully!  I've polished 1960s era plastic or acrylic crystals as well as Swatch Sistem51 watch crystals and it brought the crystals back to brand new clarity.<br />Don't be swayed by negative reviews.  The nay sayers are most likely using it on mineral glass crystals.  This is called Polywatch for a reason—&#34;poly&#34; for plastic or acrylic—not to be used on glass.  Also, a very little goes a long way; so the small tube really is much more than some reviewers would have you believe., The watch looks true to advertisement however what is not known is the 2 silver connectors on the side of the band overlap the watch so you cant see the time/face of the watch without moving the band over.  Maybe if the band was cut a little shorter then this problem would not exist.  Overall though a great product. Also delivery is a little slow since its not USA shipped but worth the wait., I was very excited to get this watch, it finally came in, one thing that i did like was what looked like quality (it is a good looking watch), it looked like it was a very good quality watch, untill metal was able to scratch the sapphire face, for me this dissapointed me very much, one because that is the whole reason i bought this was because i work in an industry where i have to be well dresses although i still do rugged work, this is why i needed a durable watch, metal should not be able to scratch (supposebly) what is supposed to be sapphire this is why i gave it a 1 star rating this is not a sapphire watch face i beleive it is more likely quartz which can easily scratch on metal., It arrived early and it was exactly what it said ., This is my 4th Invicta watch that I have gotten my husband as a gift. He loves Invicta watches, so every once in a blue moon I'll surprise him with a different watch. This one is very simple and classy. Looks even better in person. Beautiful. He is going to love it! Very Happy. If you have very big wrist, you might have to get your own wrist bands for the watch. Other than that it is beautiful and worth the price., One of the reviews that I read cast doubt on the value assessed by Amazon for this watch, but regardless, this is a very nice watch, substantial, attractive and I'm very pleased with it.  I do agree with some of the reviewers that the bands can be a bit difficult to change - I struggled for a bit with one band, didn't succeed in getting it completely inserted because the leather band is just a bit too wide, so am hoping it will slip in with time.  You know that the band mechanism is in place (if you have eyesight issues, the change process could be an issue) when you hear a click.  Which is a good thing because it's not easy aligning the stem with the tiny hole.....The watch is heavy and does roll on my wrist, but I prefer a more substantial watch to something that wont stand up to daily activities including yard work.  I'm not normally someone who would be bothered with changing watchband colors, but these bands are nice colors and the pink - a color which normally gives me hives - is a very nice shade.  Nice watch., small!, Order this watch as a birthday gift, it don't work I am sending it back and requesting a refund., Always come back to a Timex Ironman watch.  It really is a great great watch for me as a runner.  if I want to time laps, I can.  If I want to set timers for intervals, I can do that as well.  I've owned a Timex Ironman watch for almost 2 decades.  I've tried others, but always always come back to this watch. LOVE IT!, I went with a Casio solar watch instead, for $25 because of a lightning deal.  Actually I bought two watches, one red, one black., This watch is amazing. I love traveling and this watch portrays that pretty well. Shipped in a timely fashion, arrived in a Michael kors package, and the quality of the watch is great. I did have to get a few links taken out, but with any watch you do. I definitely recommend this watch., My daughter likes it. The watch looks nice. But the package is too simple., Too big!!'<br />Sticks. Out on wrist like a big case and too heavy yo wear for more than few hours., Excellent as a watct.<br />But not good enough as a bracelet.<br />I change to Leather strap, It is an inexpensive, has nice big display, and useful basic functions.  I wish the watch had a glass lens \\crystal instead of plastic., So this is not just a regular review, I have always loved the invicta company and I ordered this watch thinking I would get an inviota quality watch, but as soon as it was opened I was in awe. This watch is very beautiful but, the third day I wore this watch condensation was already built up within the crystal. I have never taken this watch in water so I assume it happened when I washed my hands, but for a divers watch this was garbage. I highly recommend to buy a different watch., Basic functions, like changing the time, are not intuitive; I was hoping that having fewer buttons would make it easier to operate. But no.<br />And due to the large &#34;Light&#34; button, I assumed, incorrectly, that it had a built-in small flashlight (like an older Casio wristwatch that I have). No again.<br />The Light button only provides a backlight for the display. The Light button failed after a day. But the watch looks good!, Perfect to remind my offspring to take her meds., The Orbita Sparta Bold is well constructed and being battery operated, you can store your watch away in a cabinet or drawer if you don't want it out. I'm sorry I didn't order the delux version which comes in a custom wooden case. I found the sound of the winder while relatively quiet, was keeping me up at night. I had wanted to keep the winder on a shelf on my nightstand but moved it into my walk in closet. Perhaps the wooden case would have muffled the sound.<br /><br />I'm able to keep my Rolex running using the extended 12 minute cycle which increases battery life. All said, I'm happy with my purchase., It does not fit the watch., If your intention is to look like a goon with no style you must own this watch. All others need not bother., Perfect for my needs.  seems durable.  I use it during my football practices.  Stopwatch feature is best, Very nice looking watch, im happy with it. My daughter loves it., This watch is very VERY pretty! Even though it's a woman s watch, it's not dainty to the point of old lady dainty. There's a huge difference! To me anyway... I hear dainty and I think old lady watch. I can say this is the perfect combination of dainty and stylish.  I thought this would be a 2 piece watch set, but it turns out that it's one. The simulated pearls wrap around your wrist while attached to the watch which makes it completely different. I like that...  You have the option of taking links out from both ends, which is good for me cause I have little wrists. If you have bigger wrists I don't think this is for you.  The clasp is great! It's a normal clasp so it shouldn't be great, but it is. I'll tell you why... I wore it, it came with a battery in it, and had to go get something out of my car. When I climbed into the backseat the watch got caught on the carpet that I had just bought. And it was STUCK. Not a regular carpet it was a shag. A gift for my neighbor. I tried to pull lightly and it didn't work. I had to YANK my hand so hard I though the pearls were going to go flying everywhere. But! They didn't. The clasp stayed shut, and you couldn't even tell that it had gone through as much as it did. I was laughing but more relieved than anything!  So. A well made watch that's pretty, with links to take out for the perfect fit and there is nothing to hate about the cute pink watch box with a pillow for the watch to lay on.  The butterfly is adorable, and the simulated pearl that is attached to the side of the watch is adorable. Even the prongs look well made.  At no point did this watch porn on my hair, irritate me, or get on my nerves. The cute rhinestone crystals that are in between the pearls are just the right amount of shine. Not overwhelming, and not underwhelming. I like that the pearls are accentuated with the crystals. Overall, it's adorable and I really like it.  I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review., My last two Seikos lasted twenty years apiece, withstanding very rough and deep treatment. This (my third) will not get nearly the use of my pevious divers (automatics each). This beastie seems to be constructed to the high standards I have come to expect from Seiko. It will probably never experience sea water, unless one of my sons gets it as a bequest. I did leave it in shallow water for seventy two hrs. I've had it for a month now and it has kept perfect time (to the second). The stopwatch funtion, for me, is superfluous but seems to function flawlessly. The solar powered operation is functioning as advertised. As for longevity I will probably never know, unless it comes to an untimely end before I do.<br />  The only fault I have been able to determine is the bezel turns too easily and has been turned upon being bumped. It (as it should be)  has a counter clockwise only movement so, if you still depend on your watch for underwater time management, it will only shorten your expired time giving you a good safety margine., THE &#34;J&#34; MODEL HAS ARIBIC SECOND LANGUAGE. THE &#34;K&#34; MODEL HAS SPANISH SECONDARY. BOTH USE THE SAME MOVEMENT.  SPRING FOR THE &#34;J&#34; FOR THE BETTER FIT AND FINISH AND THEREFORE THE ADVERTISED &#34;MADE IN JAPAN&#34;. I DON'T OWN ONE YET BUT JUST FINISHED A WEEKS RESEARCH COMPARING FEILD TESTS OF A LITTLE KNOWN WATCH COMPANY CALLED MARATHON THAT SUPPLIES SAR (SEARCH AND RESCUE) WATCHES FOR MILITARY RESCUE DIVERS. MARATHON. ADANAC. GIVE THEM A LOOK. THEY ARE THE GENERAL WATCH SUPPLIERS FOR THE US AND CANADA. DECISION: 007J-ON A MARATHON NATO STRAP OF COURSE...<br /><br />IT DOES NOT GET BETTER UNDER $800.00 OR MORE RELIABLE POSSIBLY AT ALL.<br /><br />LASTLY, WHEN IT COMES TO MARATHON GO WITH THE NASA AND MILITARY ORDERED TSAR QUARTZ WATCH. DON'T BE CAUGHT IN THE ALLURE LIGHTS OF THE AUTOMATIC AS THIS IS THE &#34;GIFT&#34; MODEL ONLY USED ACTIVELY BY THOSE IN EXTREME COLD (THINK CANADA SAR) AND WILL NEED 4-5 YEAR FULL MAINTENANCE CYCLES IF USED TO IS UNBELIEVABLY INDESTRUCTIBLE FULL WORTH AS A TRUE &#34;TOOL&#34; WATCH WHERE THE TSAR WILL TAKE A $3 BATTERY EVERY 6-7.<br /><br />BOTH WILL LAST LONGER THAN THE WRIST YOU STRAP IT TOO SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.<br /><br />IT JUST COMES DOWN TO HERITAGE, MONEY AND STYLE. YOU'LL BE DEAD BEFORE ANY OF THESE WATCHES FAIL AT SEA!<br />[[ASIN:B004U3ZIV4 MARATHON WW194006 Swiss Made Military Diver's Automatic Watch with Tritium]], Bought this for my elderly mother.  She loves the watch however it does pinch her skin/hair when putting on and off.  She leaves on day and night so not a real big issue for her., The face started fogging up the first week I wore it.  Very disappointed.  I am returning watch.  I really liked the watch, but it was defected., [[ASIN:B003YD5K4G Colibri Pocket Watch Gold Tone Mother of Pearl 586003]]<br /><br />This is a beautiful pocket watch!  The large gold numerals against the white face make it very easy to read.  It is also very light so you don't notice it in your pocket.  I adjusted it to Central Daylight time when it arrived and it has stayed on time ever since.<br /><br />I noticed some reviews talking about the chain clasp.  I have worn pocket watches for years and all but one of the chains had the same type of clasp.  I do not use the chains.  They are replace with a leather strap to hold my watch fob.  My point being to not worry about the chain clasp., Great product so far very solid and I have worn it swimming etc. update. The watch is sitting on my dresser. The pin to the strap fell out. I have reached out to the seller and manufacturer and have had no answer. Still a nice watch but cannot wear. Seller please contact me and let's sort this out, This is my 3rd one, perfect for me. Hope they don't discontinue them. Durable and holds up while working in a dusty/muddy ranch environement, This is my third one over a period of maybe 15 years. Inexpensive, plenty of features, easy to use, very accurate, durable, and the battery lasts a long time. Less obtrusive and ostentatious than many watches that seem popular at this time. Depends on your taste., Bought this watch to replace same model that I have had almost 2 years working flawlessly. Still working on same battery. Gets pretty rough treatment but &#34;keeps on ticking&#34;.  Replaced it because the band broke and it's almost as much to replace the band as a new watch., this watch is even better than I expected...the recipient is so thrilled with it., HAD A SMALL ISSUE WITH ITEM RECIEVED...CINDY AT JIDETECH REPLACED ITEM ...NO QUESTIONS ASKED...5 STARS TO JIDETECH AND CINDY...THANK YOU KEVIN, Perfect watch for work! Looks expensive but isn't., Came wonderfully packaged and brand new., This is not an up-market watch, but it worked flawlessly for my recent snorkeling trip. I recommend it., I bought this watch to replace the exact same one. I kept the same one for almost ten years and its the best watch I've ever had...I work in the hospital and have had pts try to rip this off its very durable, its got the option for two times so I keep one set to military time which I need for documenting at work...its waterproof, not clunky...I've never managed to set the alarm but i dont really need it. Its an exceptionally great timepiece., The review by Dave Evans is spot on.  I wanted a watch with some color and this fits the bill nicely.  It was between this and the red strap solar expert.  I saw both in person and ended up with the orange.  It is a watch that attracts attention especially in this color.  I have received many compliments on it.  The color makes this a casual watch and I don't wear it with more business-like attire.  The contrast of the dial and hands make this a very readable watch.  I agree that the LCD can be hard to read in certain lighting conditions but this is a minor quibble.  I do wish the hands illuminated (glowed) for those times in the evening when I just don't have enough light.  I think the a brightness setting (high or low) on the light would be helpful.  It's lightweight and very comfortable.  The watch face is big.  My wrist is a little over 7 inches in diameter and it fits nicely without the lugs extending over the edges of my wrist.  If you are considering it and have a smaller wrist, I'd try it on first at a department store or jewelry store to make sure it isn't too big.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.  UPDATE: After some time with the watch, I've discovered that the hands do glow but the lume is not very strong unless immediately out of the light.  This may be due to the color as I believe orange doesn't carry lume well.  From a practical standpoint, while they do illuminate, I have found that I need to use the light on the display if I really want to know the time., We just received this today, very fast shipping and arrived in perfect condition.  Easy to hang, not too heavy.  We found it needed to chime out its first hourly strikes before the quarterly kicked in, so wait for that before deciding the clock doesn't chime properly.  Chimes sound beautiful and ineed chime quarterly as well as on the hour.  We are very happy with this purchase!, A beautiful watch, exactly what I ordered at a good price. Delivery time was satisfactory, considering typical postal and customs delays., Beautiful watch!, My first automatic... Surprisingly, it survived 18 hours sitting idle after which it was still running, so my biggest fear of having to set the time every time i wear a different watch was handled. It was a struggle to get the links out for adjustment (compared to any Seiko or Casio), had to get a watch repair person to do it for me. In my opinion, the luminous hands were easy to see, better than a Casio but not as good as a Seiko. the watch band is high quality and doesn’t move around much (making an annoying sound which my SKA605 makes). For any first-timer like me, you have to un-screw the crown and it will pop-out a little after which you can pull it to step 1 and step 2... Invicta should really mention this in the manual too. clasp has a safety lock which is very hard, but hopefully it will loosen up after a few months., doesn't work with larger watches..., Directions for setting too complicated.  Too many buttons...  Color not as described., A very nice leather watch band, it really looks good on my Seiko SNK803 watch., A wrist watch is both a utilitarian time-telling device and a wearable accessory – a bracelet, of sorts. Tastes vary and there is really no accounting for taste when it differs from our own. That being said:<br /><br />This is, quite possibly the perfect watch for a large, left-handed man. For an average size man (which, at 5”10” and about #170, I consider myself to be) this 10020-01-BRW Highlander from Swiss Legend is apt to be experienced as a bit of an over-weight and over-sized albatross which can, of course, tell you the time.<br /><br />From the tip of the crown (the piece that pulls out to adjust the time and date) to the far edge of the watch at 3 o’clock, the distance is a full 2 ¼”. This diameter would be more normative in an average-sized pocket watch – meant to be worn on a chain and not on a wrist. The depth of the watch is a ½ inch. Consider these measurements against those of a watch you have and like to wear. If they seem extreme, this is not the timepiece for you. It is ‘masculine’ (hoping that no large woman will take umbrage)  – it is virile (so states the advertising) – and it is BIG.<br /><br />Its design is noteworthy in a couple of important respects beyond the sheer mass of it. The three controls (crown and 2 push-buttons) are situated on the left side of the watch, rendering adjustments nearly impossible for a right-handed person without taking the watch off. As a guitar player, I liken this to giving a right handed person a guitar strung and set up for a left-handed person and expecting them to play it as though everything was just fine. It isn’t.<br /><br />Mechanically, the watch appears sound and, at least for an initial week or keeping an eye on it (and wearing it several times) it keeps accurate time. I cannot comment on its accuracy over an extended period. The buttons and crown controls work as described in the (most welcome) printed manual that accompanies this watch in a plush cushioned box.<br /><br />Being a wrist-watch enthusiast (I own and wear 12 of them) I have seen large watches before and am aware that mounting the adjustment controls and crown on the left side of the watch seems like a good idea to some people – I must assume they are mostly “Lefties” trying to make their own needs and preferences more of a standard.<br /><br />In this world, I do believe that there is something for everyone. If there is a large left-handed man on your Christmas list (who likes accessories consistent with his size) this watch is worth considering … Or, perhaps for a small person who wants to look, somehow, “big time.”t (I own and wear 12 of them) I have seen large watches before and am aware that mounting the adjustment controls and crown on the left side of the watch seems like a good idea to some people – I must assume they are mostly “Lefties” trying to make their own needs and preferences more of a standard.<br /><br />In this world, I do believe that there is something for everyone. If there is a large left-handed man on your Christmas list (who likes accessories consistent with his size) this watch is worth considering … Or, perhaps for a small person who wants to look, somehow, “big time.”, Very  very  classic,  the blue tone did it all, I took it to  MK store  and  got some  links  taken  out  for free. A little  heavy but perfect  for me., My favorite watch! I am wearing it as a write this review in fact. The time sets itself to the exact second, and the compass works great! I am not a weather expert, so as for the barometer, I assume it works correctly. The thermometer is effected by your body heat, so to get an accurate reading you have to take your watch off for a while. [To those out there who break things easily]- This is the watch for you. I have smashed this thing countless times and it's still fine!, Got this to wear while flying. Climbing around the airplane doing pre-flight checks, didn't want to be constantly banging up my mechanical Tissot; also wanted a watch I could have both local and &#34;Zulu&#34; time set on. This is a dual timezone watch; I leave one timezone set to UTC and the analog hands (and the &#34;other&#34; digital display, set separately) set to local time. There's a usable backlight and the hands are luminous for a while after light goes away. There's a stopwatch feature I've used a couple of times. It's overall a pretty good watch. Only real complaints: (1) The digital time can be nigh impossible to read behind the analog hands; and (2) setting the analog hands is a tedious process, though you only have to do it twice a year., Now let's be perfectly clear here. This is not a true Tourbillion movement. Tourbillion movements cost thousands of dollars, and are produced by skilled watchmakers, as these are one of the most difficult watch complications to make. If you want to look at a beautiful Tourbillion movement, look at one of Jaeger Le Coultre Tourbillion movements, then gasp at the price tag, lol. Inexpensive watchmakers are mounting the balance wheel on the face of the watch and are calling them Tourbillion movements. This however, is a nice little watch. Has a 22 jewel Asian automatic movement. Has working moon phase, 24 hour hand, and red second hand above the balance wheel. It is a stainless steel case with exhibition back so you can see the movement. The rotor is even stamped, so it lends it a little more class than a plain rotor. The automatic winding is as quite as I've ever heard in an automatic watch, no ratchety winding noise. Quiet. Tinted mineral glass crystal. The band fits well, and looks good but is PU leather, so I put a new Hadley-Roma leather strap on it. It looks even better now. Keeps good time, only gaining about a minute or so a week, which should even out with more wear. For 43 bucks you could do worse. Has no date. Good looking watch. Nice retro looks, big, but not gaudy big, as big watches are &#34;in&#34; now., Works better than some high end watch winders, Its ok, the chain broke the first day, its too flimsy.  I just use the watch part. Not really what I was looking for., Love this model. It's cool to have the timer and stopwatch, barometer, world time. I has two and ordered another just now.<br />The first watch band broke.<br />The second watch leaked in a swimming pool. It happened outside the warrantee period!<br />Because they are only $40 I'm happy to get another.<br />But beware!, Worth it, Too loose on my wife's arm. And it looks better in the picture than in person. But other than that the return was really easy to deal with thanks, This watch looks exactly like the picture. It's not a Rolex but it is a pretty watch you can wear everyday and not have to worry about. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Time is keeping good so far.  I would recommend this product. I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review., This is my favorite watch and gets so many compliments.  Unfortunately, shortly after receiving the watch one band broke.  Recently the second band broke so I can't secure the watch band or wear the watch.  I wish I could get replacement part, Larger than expected., stopped working, outstanding, Its very good option to buy, elegant and cute smartwatch, it was awesome, The best, The material is extremely cheap. It broke the next day, I was pleasantly  surprised with this watch...very vintage looking..I love vintage jewelry...the abalone inserts added a beautiful touch to the marcasite stones...the only problem...the bracelet had to be adjusted...the pins are sooo small that only a jeweler could adjust the wrist bands...I do recommend this product., Nothing fancy, lightweight and attractive!, Wasn't the quality I had expected, Top!, Exact replacement for my vintage Seiko dive watch. I decided to inspect my spring bars after many years of service, I'm glad I did. The internal springs were fatigued and were holding only by corrosion, sure way to lose a watch. The new spring bars from JP Leather works are well finished and machined perfectly., Better than the bang-around watch I expected., Very elegant, Absolutely amazing! Love the watch!! Nothing I could dislike about it! Wish I could give it 100 stars! I changed the band because I'm not a fan of leather bands but the watch is perfect!! Six days and hasn't lost a second! Got a spring bar tool set and love switching up the bands, great watch for any occasion, even took it to a water park. UPDATE- It looses a second a week. Still a great watch! I've had it for about three weeks or so and it's still my favorite in my collection! I put the seiko &#34;monster watch&#34; metal band on it and it looks even better!, I LOVE MY NEW TINKERBELL WATCH!!! I HAVE HAD MANY COMPLIMENTS ON IT TOO., I am very happy with my new watches., Okay, my bad!  I did not read these reviews before I bought this watch.  The reviews are consistently true.<br />The numbers on the outside rubbed off within a few days.  The watch band was too big so I cut it off and re-sewed it to make it fit.  After I had cut the band I noticed the letters missing.  Eh!  My grandson loves his batman watch design, but it doesn't look like this picture.  I WOULD NOT purchase this watch again!!, Very cute, I like the look and everything but was disappointed that it needed a battery and the instructions didn't explain how to set the date. I shouldn't have to spend more money for a battery for a brand new watch., It's ok it keeps stopping not happy. Good thing I have my phone for time., Cool, This watch is perfect.  It's shiny and really nice looking on your wrist.  I have an average size wrist and it is just the right amount of loose.  I think it will be easy to read but not worried about it.  For me it's more jewelry.  I really love it and it was priced right.  This is my second Anne Klein and I have not been disappointed yet.  The shipping was also very fast.  Thank you I am a happy customer., This clock didn't work. I don't know if it was a faulty mechanism or a dead battery.<br />Also, only the numbers and the very tips of the hands are painted with glow-in-the-dark material. The clock is tiny. So I couldn't see what time it is in the dark. Useless. I think the hands should have glowed too. Luckily I was able to return it., The amount of detail in this authentic Bulova watch speaks for itself. The watch looks almost exactly as the picture portrays it.<br /><br />The watch is fairly easy to adjust with the proper tools and looks sharp once properly fitted. This is obviously not a watch you would wear to a BBQ, but is perfect for the office or formal events.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Note: Other retailers will charge much more then what is offered on Amazon. This is a great deal., I like this product!, The watch arrived in excellent condition, however I've had a couple of big issues with it. The first is that during some afternoons the watch's day window will switch to it's non-English language option and stay there until adjusted. Second, after wearing the watch for three weeks, it began to run slow. Because Amazon is not a Luminox authorized dealer, the watch's 2-year warranty is invalid. Therefore, it will cost $55 at a minimum (that is if the battery only needs to be replaced) to have it fixed. Not something I wanted to pay for after owning the watch for just over a month..., The watch in general is a beautiful piece, as a real bulova stuff, a just have one suggestion, they should post a picture of the side size of the watch, since it is higher than expected., Very elegant, excellent, Not top quality, but it works for the occasional repair., It's a nice watch overall. I'm returning it because it's way too big. it looks like a man's watch., Not teal and dead battery-tried to change battery-could not back off., I like this clock, the style is what I was looking for.  Two things - the instructions for setting time/alarm, etc are light at best, just symbols and pictures.<br />The other is that I can't read the time in the dark, the hands glow but not enough to be useful, at least for me.  I also don't like the constant green or amber glow, so I turned that off.  To read the time in the dark I press the snooze bar, and while holding it down, the light glows so I can tell if the alarm is on or off, and also what time it is., I like the design of the band but it is really large. The watch face has a shiny back which makes it a bit hard to read the time when in brighter light. I could deal with all of that but I gave it a low score because I have had to reset the time ever day., Thank You, The watch band was nice and time, but there were no spring pin with the watch band., I found this watch and after telling my fiancé about this, she bought it for me. I knew the moment I got it that it was now the favored watch of my collection. I've owned more expensive watches but none with more value. If you can get over the fact that you're only paying $200 for it, its weight, quality and design and impressive. However, its not perfect. Its still so appreciated that it deserves 5 stars imo but there are drawbacks. For one, realize you're buying a massive watch. I'm not typically into modern, wide face, gigantic gaudy watches...this watch only gets a pass because its not really gaudy, its fine, somewhat minimalistic and artistic. But it is gigantic and wide faced. Its cumbersome at times. I have to take it off to type on my laptop which makes it impractical to wear all day through without removing it once or twice. It also has a way of jumping out and smacking against things you walk by, unless you're accustomed to wearing a watch this deep, wide and heavy. I'm slowly getting used to that. I've also had problems with the accuracy of the hands. The hour hand is never precisely where it should be, its too far back in time. When its 10:30, the hour hand will just be on 10. I can reset the watch forward a few times but that just means I'll have the same problem 2 days later. If you're finicky, this may be more of an issue but again, I give this watch a lot of passes for its aesthetics and durability. I truly can't say if this is the case with all &#34;perpetual motion&#34; watches but it doesn't hold energy for long. You have to either wear this watch every other day or resign yourself to re-setting it when you put it on. It runs out of energy within 2 to 3 days depending on how much I wear it before putting it away. It is more than adequate once put on. Once you set it and put it on your wrist, it wont stop moving until you put it away for a bit. In the end, I've heard more positive remarks on this watch than any other I've had. People tell me its the nicest watch they've ever seen. It really is clever and un-obtuse for an Invicta which often goes for sheer volume of flash and size; this model has a bit more foresight aesthetically than typical. Some of my other friends with Invictas can really only wear them to a night on the town or else risk someone in the normal world ridiculing them (me included) for wearing a screaming grandfather clock. My first time really out with it was on a boat in Newport where everyone around me by default was successful or part of a successful household and it drew compliments from all manner of people (the better part of them certainly more successful than myself). This watch does have a dignified bearing about it, still a little showy but in the end pretty well dignified... Its both a skeleton AND a perpetual motion watch meaning the clockwork is very lean and minimal, you should expect that it is not as perfect mechanically; however it does suffice functionally and you can't argue with a pretty face... If you're an aspiring rapper, you'll like that it comes with an MSRP price tag attached that says $1995 on it, just leave it hanging so no one has to ask., OK, Bought this for my mom for her Mother's Day and she loves it, She get a lot of comments about it when ever she wears it, We had this watch for only 1 month and then it broke. The outside red circle thing was able to be twisted around (not sure if it is supposed to do that) My son wore it to school one day and came home crying because it fell apart while he was doing his math center. The red ring came off and then the plastic that housed the watch hands came off so we had to throw it in the garbage., COOL, Awesome watch from Citizen here. The chrono is accurate, it looks great on the wrist and has a good solid feel and weight to it. If I were to change anything on this it would be the band that does rattle a bit and feels cheap., It is so beautiful, not sure how well it keeps time but it needs to be wound every 24 hours.  The pics of it are very accurate., I have a Guess Collection watch that I bought before I was married back in 1998.  I bought the watch at Macy*s on 34th street for $200.  I've had the watch for 17 years and its still in tack.  Everything is still working like back in 1998.  I saw this watch and I had to get it.  It was original $450.00<br />and I bought it for $250., I just could not like this get away.  I'm keeping my eyes on another of Guess Collection watches, but it's $550.00.  Just waiting for the price to go way dooown.  I've have had lots of people stopping me to ask what kind of watch is that, and I let then know what kind of watch it is.  It's worth the money and time to buy this watch.  You won't regarded it!<br />Ramfis, I really like my watch, but the outside bezel came off immediately after I opened the box. I did slip some gorilla glue under it to stabilize it. I have now had the watch for over a year and love it. But you will have to do some fix up., COOL, I had several ironman watches over the years. This one is the best because the band is the thinnest. It does not even bother me during a yoga session., Bought one for my self and its very nice looking but just a little hard to read in direct sun light at times.<br />I then bought one for my friend and I hate it, it came scratch up like its used and the watch it self was now black and not silver like the exact same one I bought before, Better than what I expected!!, So glad to have a new Citizen watch!, Beautiful watch - my wife loves it!  Nice quality as usual with Fossil, and the size is easy for her to see without being too big.  Very pleased - it was a big hit for her birthday!, awesome!  the only problem is no problem. i just need a tuff watch that will keep the time. this thing<br />does whole lot of stuff i don't need,. but if i ever do?<br />thank you!, As other reviewers have noted, the watch just won't stay white. I'm on my second one, and this time I actually got a person from Support at Timex on the phone. Apparently this is a known problem with their resin bands - even if you never wear sunscreen or anything else, it's going to turn orange gray on you. Because of this, they sell replacement bands (like $20), but although it's a good watch, I'm getting tired of running to the jewelers (no you can't replace it yourself) or buying a new one every 6 months. Time to try something else., Trash , dont buy this item, My all time favorite watch! Has everything I need, and a few things I don't, but is still so simple to understand. Really is waterproof, Ive gone snorkeling with it on, I sweat all over this thing, and i wear it in the showers. the one I wear now I've used for two years, the one before that 6 months and I only replaced it because i lost it. If I wanted to buy another watch just to have diversity and switch them every so often I would just buy another one of these of the same color. I recommend it to everyone, Well, it's probably okay, because it was delivered within a reasonable time (coming all the way from China) and does look exactly like the picture. However, none of the tiny screws actually fit ANY of my glasses. So for me, it is completely useless. Too bad., JUST OKAY, Nearly identical to another aviator watch that sells for over $100.  Like this one better because it is polished vs brushed.  The day function is really cool., perfect, I like it very much!, My husband loves this watch.  In his career he goes back and forth between inside and outside all day.  He is a boat salesman so we needed a watch that could withstand being wet and sweaty and this is perfect for that! The band is not effected at all when it gets wet or sweaty.  He is very tough on stuff and this lasted him all summer.  He recently fell and it caught on something and the clasp broke off, but it would have with any watch. We are planning on buying the same watch again to replace the one that broke., Elegant, I love it!<br /><br />But the strap is a little bit short., The compass feature with the crown knob on the left side is useless., No watch at all, only an empty box., I had to return it as it several large scratches. I was not impressed by its quality.  Ended up buying a different model., I like this item.  It did not fit around my husband's wrist.  I had to send it back because it pinched his wrist.  My husband has a very big weist and I need a super big wrist band for him to wear the watch., 'So disappointing this watch no longer features an Indiglo light-up face. My son loved his old one, but this one is just 'blah'. And yeah, go ahead and order the replacement batteries- you'll need it within a few months of purchase., Purchased this watch for a formal event as I like to wear something different each time I go somewhere.<br /><br />I must say the watch looks great in person and goes well with any formal or semi-formal wear. I wouldn't wear it as a daily watch as it would be overkill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Elegant detailed face<br />- Presentation: packaged like a more expensive watch<br />- Sturdy watch band<br />- Accurate hands with ability to set the current day<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not sure if it's just my particular watch, but the clasp has opened unintentionally a few times<br />- Selecting the day can be tricky as it can change when you push the dial in once selected (you have to be precise and not spin the dial at all once you pick the day)<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone, especially someone who doesn't have this style of watch in their collection yet or is debating picking one up for an upcoming formal event. You will not be disappointed., Excellent quality, no hair pulling on wrist, fits the Seiko diver perfectly., A very accurate watch. It loses about 3 seconds per month. I've owned at least 6 of this model and only one was not this good. Highly recommended., I guess everybody has had one or two of these in the time they have been around. This is the first one I've had that was not either too big or too small--it's &#34;just right&#34; for me. As usual, more features than a person really needs but reliable and pretty much bombproof. It is NOT as large as the men's version, and very light and comfortable on the wrist., Just perfect and a much nicer watch than I expected for the price.  I can see where a man with a big wrist might have a problem.  But personally I love it, Very easy to use!, The leather strap is difficult to fit on the hand. And the clock inside was twisted. It didn't face the right direction so you cannot read the time, I love the look of the face of this watch. It's super unique with the wood grain and looks just as good as the photo. I believe the quality is good (though it will take some time to tell). I'm also a fan of their sunglasses.<br /><br />The only issue I had is the watch strap is waaay too long and it's not adjustable on one side, so you can tighten it to where you need, but then the end of the strap comes all the way back around to face of the watch and looks a bit funny. Once I replace the band, it won't be an issue., The watch is wonderful and my son loves how it links to his phone.  Also, it aids him a lot as a cross country runner., This appears even more delicate in person. It is a very pretty watch and even with the gems, has a classy look to it., It's awesome but the compass is a joke you have to set it where ever you are and that's not the way it should work other than that it's good, loved this one so much I ordered similar watches that were available- Comfortable, and easy to wear and read. don't understand all the buttons, but that's okay, Present for young girl....she is happy with it., I like the charm bracelet, but the watch stopped working only a few days after I my husband gave it to me. The problem is that it doesn't take a battery, so it's an old fashioned style, but you can't wine it up, or replace a battery., I believe to be all I thought.  The band is a little hard to get off because of the rubber to rubber contact.  However it is actually a lot easier to read than I thought., This is a great looking watch and the woodgrain is beautiful. The hands and hour marks are illuminated and the date window is easy to set on the correct date. It's surprisingly light weight and can hardly be felt when you're wearing it. The pins in the links however, we're very difficult to remove and one of the links broke while trying to remove it. Luckily it was the link that was being taken off. All in all, it's a great time piece for the price, and looks 100 times better in person., This is a very nice watch for the price.  The band and watch feel and look good.  It is a men's watch.  At this price, I wasn't concerned that the quality be perfect.  There is some spotting on the Mickey face and ears where the paint isn't all there.  The spots are tiny and you have to look close to see.  For me, that was worth the cheaper price., My husband is a watch expert. He owns an impressive collection of watches by top brands. He ordered this watch winder for his collection.<br />The winder looked nice and was easy to use, however it made a lot of noise and winding system did not work very well. We ended up returning it and purchasing much more expensive winder., The Casio watch is really comfortable, simple, but elegant! The only bad thing is the light that doesn't light that well. Plus the watch is too small. But it's good for the price 👌🏻, Somewhat bigger than passed watches I've purchased. Easy to set, keeps accurate time. Very nice leather band also. So far love it., Awesome. Velcro is tough. Im a Vet Tech and I need a watch that can take some beatings and possibly a bite or 2 to protect my wrist. This watch does the trick., Awesome watch., I purchased this for a second time after I lost my first one. Everything about this watch is great – just make sure you really push down hard on the clamps to secure it to your wrist! I've worn mine everyday for half a year now and I don't see the mesh bracelet wearing out unlike what others have experienced. I only wished they had an alternate version of this design with a date display., 5 years with the Timex Weekender and still a great watch.  One week with the Timex Expedition Scout and it no longer works. Time adjustment knob fell off., This watch is awesome!  I bought it for my husbands birthday and he loved it!  It's very cool looking !  Looks very stunning on. Classy ! I wasn't at all sure of the brown wrist band but it's beautiful!  Great buy !, Fantastic!!!, Looks fashionable and is comfortable to wear.  Downside: the buttons in that they are very small and difficult to press if you have large fingers, especially the stopwatch reset (top left).  I am unable to press any of the buttons while wearing gloves.  The watch looks durable, but in reality its a basic digital timepiece surrounded by a one mm thick piece of matt black plastic., This is the swatch watch to end all swatch watches. You can't buy a swatch that represents the essence of swatch more than this. Super cool. Definitely a conversation starter! And the quality of swatch is awesome., The face is too small as well as the bank....thought both would be much larger., I love this item and the price was very good. However, it does not seem to keep time. Once I have set the correct time later in the day i will look and and it is either several hours ahead or behind. I thought maybe i had not pushed the pin in all the way when setting the time but after doing so i still experienced the same issue., love it.. clasp a bit cheap, but overall, good looking watch.., Pretty Nice watch and affordable price. I really like the design, SO COOL, Great watch. This is my first metal bracelet watch and it is very comfortable to wear. The face is easy to read and it just looks manly. The only criticism I have is that the date window is RIDICULOUSLY tiny. Virtually unreadable. And the dark gray color is wearing off the bracelet where my arm rests on my desk at work. The waterproofing works as advertised, as I wore it while body surfing with adverse effects to the watch. Overall a very nice watch for the price., Clock hands quick working this week. Put new batteries in it but the hands still will not work. For the price we paid, I would have thought the clock would have lasted longer!, The watch was a gift for my little sister and she liked it very much; it flashes a lot in a dark room!! It fits her nice because this watch has a 35 mm case diameter, which is fine for her cause she has small hands and wrists. Good product., I returned this item the 1st time because digital numbers do not work.  Received a replacement with the exact same problem., Amazing watch!, Came broken had to send back, Its delivered quicker than the estimated time which I am surprised! The quality is good despite there are some stains inside the box and i like it so much overall!, I love the design. I think it looks better than the new breitling military watch. I'm glad I did some research before the purchase., Horrible buy!!! It always stayed behind time. I could not trust this watch to tell me the time so I put it away. For a few month I checked on the time it displayed and about a couple month in, it was an hour behind. I bought the orange version :\\ oh boy did it get dirty... Carry soap around for this reason. I'm sure some people have soap on them. Another con is the material the band is made of. I have never had any skin reaction to any material that had came in contact with my skin except this watch. Rashes, burn, itch, etc. I used it for a month but kept it for over a year, it always showed the wrong time. The light is dimmed and scattered. Finally I gave it to a homeless man who said he doesn't care about the time. After all it can be only used as a collectible item., a little cheaper looking than I expected.But it seems to keep good time. I have only had it a few days so I am not really sure of it., The band was better quality than the original watch band  and am very pleased to have the new one,  It is also less expensive than what you find in the local stores, Typical, I received my Stuhrling Original black dial watch in a very nice and secured packaging not to mention the fast shipment. Please refer for photo of the watch from other reviewers. Although a bit small (42mm) since I'm used to wear size 47mm+ this watch is very nicely built and very attractive for the price. I recommend it to those looking for stylish but affordable with a touch of elegance watch... can be an everyday watch if preferred. Buy it and judge it yourself. Thanks again Amazon!, watch is too heavy. bought it for my father., No light or illuminated hour and minute hands.  Can't read at night in the dark.  Keeps great time and is sleek, but doesn't do much good if you can't see what time it is., For some reason I never wrote a review, but I've had this watch for almost 2 years now, and it never fails to earn me compliments. I've worn it nearly every day, have accidentally worn it in the ocean and in pools, and it has not yet shown me trouble. The indiglo light faded about 2 months ago, but that's totally OK in comparison to the time this watch has proved useful. Its worth the price, I swear., Great watch, low price. I bought it because it shows the date and has a bright indiglo feature. It says waterproof and suitable for swimming and showering. I wanted a watch to wear out at the lake or kayaking that can get wet and I don't have to worry about it (not planning on scuba diving with it.) Or if I lose it or break it at least the price is low enough that I'll be disappointed but will live to see another day!, Identical replacement from Casio.  Perfect!, i like it., I bought the watch and wore it at work only for a month... and the black color started to peel!! I have a desk job (it's not like i do heavy work) and i always take care of my stuff and use them delicately. Don't buy from this seller. I sent them an email and they never responded. Such a disappointment!!!, I bought this for my boyfriend and it was a hit, particularly the stitching on the sides. It is kind of bulky though.. more so than expected but not more than I guess most men's watches are.  NOTE: when I bought it I thought the face was dark blue (it looks blue on my computer) but it's actually black.. still very nice., This watch is every bit as elegant and understated in real life as in the listing. One thing to note is that I am a man with somewhat slender wrists, and the band size is perfect for me. If your wrist is of a more sturdy dimension, you may need a larger band., It was a HUGE HIT WITH MY 7 year old son. The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars, is the battery was practically dead. Still it was a huge hit., COOL, While the watch looks very nice, the numbers are very hard to read except in certain light.  Since I wanted to wear this every day, it would not work for me and I sent it back., I bought this for my boyfriend because his watch broke. It looks nice for the price I paid but it's nothing fancy. He has said he gets a lot of compliments on it., excellent!!!, Thanx, This is a very nice box, the quality of the workmanship is excellent, the high gloss coat makes the wood seem like it is hand rubbed to perfection. The hidden hinges are a nice touch, & the hidden magnets keep the box closed with just the right amount of tension. The wood has a rich grain that stands out, and is beautiful to the eye. The interior matches the quality of the box, it feels like a high quality leather, very soft to the touch, although I'm not sure if it is leather, or if it is &#34;pleather&#34;, (Plastic Leather&#34;), regardless it seems to me that this box would be worth it, at double the price....., Got the package today, gift for my boyfriend, he loves it! Perfect!, Product is as expected., Arrived on time, and quite cute!, perfect., slim and elegant, Excellent seller and product!, Because 1. the analog portion of the watch was defective, 2. the digital portion of the watch had a poor display, and 3. the function buttons for the digital watch made little sense... I had to give this watch one, solitary, star. If it didn't look so good, I would have given it a zero! Returned it to Amazon for a refund 😞, I wouldn't recommend this to everybody, but for the last month I've been timing my laps swimming on it.  After my first set, I whip my goggles off, check the split, press the buttons, and do another set of laps.  Have had no problems with the water getting into the watch, it's been a dream.  I wouldn't recommend this for everybody, but I wanted to push the limits a little bit and see how this held up., Simple.  No Frills.  Classic!, It's too big 😡, this clock is pretty awesome. Looks good and has a perfect size for your desk. Definitely worth the money. Glad I purchased one., I order a 2 tier and got one tier !! Rip off, complete satisfaction, Great watch band, but I am disappointed by 2 things:<br />1. The silver buckle is too big. I wish it didn't flare out.<br />2. The nylon is only a thin layer. This is a black leather watch band with a thin layer of nylon on top and a thin tan leather layer underneath.<br />Overall I'm happy with this band, but I'm going to look for another full nylon band in the future., This is a very nice watch. It fits the wrist well and is subtle but still has a stylish face. The band is made of leather but has a somewhat cheap look which really does this time piece a disservice and this is the reason I can't give it 5 stars. I'm on the look out for a band that befits the build quality of this watch to make it perfect., I picked this watch up with the TW2P71500. Immediately I put a normal leather band on it, this band was nice - but I prefer an normal band. I really like the blue face, it's a darker navy. The numbers are white, the hands are silver. This is the one thing I would change about the watch - and something I didn't initially consider. It's not a deal breaker, but with the white numbers I'd prefer the continuous look of the white hands on the chrono dials and overall. It's a great watch overall, it doesn't tick as loud as the smaller (both in thickness and dial size) Weekenders. I have tried to listen for the normal Timex tick, but unless right up next to my ear it's not noticeable.<br /><br />Great watch, I'd recommend. It's moved to near the top of my watch choices., Ordered this great watch and enjoyed everything about it. For something that was brought on a deal making it less than $40, It was really worth the purchase. Since I'm satisfied with it. 5 stars to the watch. Would recommend to anyone, Beauty, elegance, and functionality all in one package. The slim side profile makes this watch ride low on the wrist. There's just no bulkiness to it. Though the face is fairly large, it is offset by the slender nature of the remaining watch characteristics. Arrives in a very nice metal box that's worth keeping., Good value and very comfortable.  A little concerned about the longevity.  Seems a little delicate., I love the looks of this watch. It is easy to read and the band is very comfortable., the box looks like fake seiko, I love this watch!  It's perfect!  I get many compliments on it. It's easy to read., I get so many compliments on this watch, I just love it.  I was hesitant on buying it on amazon but it was a great deal and it is the real deal., I gave 5 stars for the value of a seiko watch at the price of a timex...<br />The watch is extremely light you won't remember your wearing it.<br />With it being rated for 30 meters makes it a good watch to wear lounging at pool or light snorkeling. .have put to mentioned test and so far so good.<br />Would recomended this watch, COOL, Amazing quality and arrived on time. The watch looks fancy and not cheap at all. Love it., Change color before I get a chance to wear it., Sorry to say that I bought this watch. Trusting amazon merchant place. Sadly the watch stopped working after ownership at 6 months. It sat on my dresser for another couple months. I thought it was just a battery. Finally took it it in and dicovered that there were more issues with it . It is not returnable even though it's been lees then 12 months. What's the deal with that! It seems like this wad not a new watch when sold to me. But poorly reconditioned!!!, Absolutely love wearing this watch.  It's the same watch I had back in the 80s when I was 13 years old.  Wish Casio would keep overall look but add update such as backlight and other minimal features.  But even without this the watch is pretty good., Beautifully eye catching watch ...... Works well ... Wht more ✔, Watch is gorgeous -- one HUGE problem..... it doesn't tick.  Yep ---- doesn't work.  I'm going to have to take it to a watch shop and get a new battery put in -- I was shocked and disappointed -- hugely.  I was SO looking forward to receiving and wearing this right away --- but -- it doesn't work!  I couldn't believe it!  VERY SAD ----, POOOOOOR QUALITY, Good value.  Weakest part is the band.  This is my 3rd watch and all have eventually had the band  crack and split.  For the value I keep buying the watch., Superb quality and design. Very lightweight., After I moved my 2015 short interest return past 50% I decided to reward myself with this beautiful watch., This is a very elegant wristwatch! I thought it was beautiful before I ordered it, but it is a knock out in person.<br />It keeps great time as well. I get lots of compliments!, I gave it to my friend's 7 year old daughter and they both loved it., Me encantó, Love the look and feel of this watch. It's a real attention getter, which is what I was looking for. Quality if very good for the price., OKAY, these were exactly what I needed to finish out a project., Nice watch for me.  Not too big on my wrist as so many are made these days.  Just right.  I love the band, very comfortable.  It took me awhile to get accustomed to a self winding watch as it's been years since I had one without a battery, but it's not bad at all.  My only dink is that the display appearance is a bit cluttered looking but I like having a day/date and moving second hand., I've only had the watch a couple of weeks but it is exactly what I had expected. It's a classic, no frills beautiful watch. Bold numbers. Nice, visible arms and date. For the price, so far, I'm very satisfied., I love my watch, the only bad thing is the the batery died after barely using it for 2 months., cheap watch to amuse son-never worked right, even after replacing, Just the right size and features, This watch is perfect!  Its not large like many other Michael Kors watches.  It is extremely beautiful and classy!  This order arrive extremely quickly despite paying for the cheapest shipping - I ordered it on Saturday and it arrive in Canada on Wednesday morning.  Very impressive!, This my second Expedition.  I like the size and easy to read face as well as the lighting.  Very durable and easy to wear., Great band! Worth the buy! Not for bigger wrists.. Fit my wrist just right!, perfect, like everything about it - nice clean look, weight (heavy, but not clunky), keeps good time, and receive more compliments on this watch than my victorinox chrono classic, which cost more and disappointingly filled with water after about a year and a half., The watch was OK but It lost over two minutes a day  Sent it back., Like it a lot......  Not a jump out and a little hard to tell time at night.  The hands don't light up., Beautiful color. accurate time., i would pay 40.00 for this watch, Not as advertised, Love the watch these bands fit.  The bands wear out so I stock up on these.  The watch is one of the thinnest and lightest I have seen.  Digital dial is easy to read., all products arrived in excellent condition thank you very much, all products arrived in excellent condition thank you very much, This is the worst watch...do not buy.  Moisture built up in it after less than 6 months.  I wasted time and money sending it back to be fixed.  A couple of months after I sent it in for repairs, it won't run at all.   This is a total waste of money.    What a scam., The watch arrived with a dead battery.  Taking the back off you can see how cheaply made it is.  It will work great for my costume but I'm not sure how long it would stand up to everyday use.  The cover is spring loaded so you don't have to worry about it flopping open, This is an amazing watch. I purchased it for a steep discount on Prime Day, but I would pay at least 2x what I paid that day.<br /><br />It is a LARGE watch, so be wary of that. I'm over six and a half feet tall, so it fits my wrist just fine, but even so, people can recognize how large it is. That happens to be a desired feature for me, but it might not be for you!<br /><br />OH! And this is really important! Setting the watch is not at ALL like it says it is in the included book. Here's how it works: you have a large dial on the right-hand side, and above that, a recessed button. Pulling the dial all the way out allows you to set the time, and that's how you set the day of the week as well - just spin the hands until you arrive at the correct day of the week (and time within that day). Keep in mind that, since the watch is tracking both the date and the day, you need to treat setting the watch like it's military time - there IS a difference between 10:15AM and 10:15PM! Just spin the hands to 12 o'clock and see if the day and date advance; you'll know which one is which then. To set the date, use a ball-point pen and click the recessed button in. Each click will move the date one forward. Definitely set the time and day before the date, as if you advance the hands enough, the date will of course move on its own.<br /><br />That should do it! Good luck!, I like the watch and the timer, and the back light. remember though, it is white. :/, If its to big here a sugestion take it to the jewlery store and have them remove a few link duhh did u think it was magicly gunna be your size, Great traditional looking watch.  I have a 10 year old Stuhrling watch that runs better and requires less maintenance than my Rolex Datejust, a $4,500 watch.  Hope this watch and the black faced one run lIke my old Stuhrling., My first impression of this watch was that it might a little too small. My previous watch was 43mm and this is a 41mm. However, after spending a day with it, the size is fine. I think it's the perfect size for a watch, not too big, not too small. I have a 7 inch wrist and it complements it nicely. The watch feels very premium and looks like it is of a higher quality than it is. It might not be made by Citizen, Seiko, etc, but this watch has a great mechanical movement and the finish is very nice and shiny. A deep luminous yellow. Probably the nicest finish I've ever seen on a watch. The dragon design and diamonds look very nice as well. Definitely worth the price for this piece of jewelry. The packaging is also very nice and comes with a great warranty and notes from the seller that show they stand by the product. However, some of the cons would be the watch resizer that comes with the watch. The links are stuck in pretty well and the resizer is very flimsy. I actually bent the resizer tip. You''ll basically have to get it resized by a jeweler. I took it to wal-mart and they could not resize it either. Also, some other minor flaws, if you look carefully on the picture, there are no diamonds on the 8 and 10 o clock hour spots. And the links in the bracelet aren't fully given a gold tone. The inside parts are still gray. Doesn't really bother me though because the finish that is visible is very nice and has no marks on it anywhere. Might not be a big brand watch, but deff one of a kind. Dragon, shiny flawless finish, shiny hands, mechanical movement, diamonds, great warranty, sapphire crystal. Worth the price., The watch came a day ahead of schedule! I love it, it's so comfortable and lightweight, and fits great on my tiny wrists! It's everything I thought it would be :), I wanted to like this watch, good clean design, low profile fits under dress shirts...  BUT the build quality felt quite cheap; very loose fit in all the pin joints in the link band. The watch would rattle and make chink noises.  Also, and this is a problem (in general) with link-style bands and smaller wrists, I just couldn't get this watch to fit comfortably.  one-link too big and slides about my wrist too much, one-link too few and it's locked in place cutting off blood circulation.  I returned this watch for another Skagen with a metal mesh band which i like much better now., Was a gift- she loved it. Although, future product design tip, maybe have the second face, be a calendar., This was a gift, This is not my first Ingersoll watch but is certainly a favorite amongst a rather large collection of many different brands. It has all the nice features, keeps excellent time for a mechanical watch, is sized right and wears comfortably even on my relatively small 7 1/4 inch wrist. Had always wanted one of these Bison 18's so, at this deeply discounted price, I couldn't pass it up, it was really cool looking, key word WAS, the latch is worthless and I lost it 2 days after receiving it., This watch practically looks like its made of water, so its a natural for anyone who is in water sports like my daughter.<br /><br />Its a simplistic watch, without too many functions, which is always good.  I think the display is a bit more crowded than it should be, with the &#34;days of the week&#34; on permanent display... I think that was a bit of overkill.<br /><br />At its price point, its a good watch for the money.  And the cute shiny bezel and overall good looks make it an easy choice., Not what I expected!!!, It is a nice watch but stopped keeping time after a couple of days. And sometimes it won't work unless I shake it., Fine for the price. I would recommend it to those who work a lot with their hands and go through watches like socks., Watch band is a joke. My son wore this watch for a couple hours before it loosened and fell off. Couldn't keep the band tight. Don't waste your money., It was four days late. However, I absolutely love this watch! I don't find it hard to read at all (I just read the digital part that says the time). Totally recommend it, I definitely want another one. Oh, and I'm tiny so I was worried it would be too big on my wrist, and it's not at all. Perfect size. :), This watch is heavy make no doubt about it. Hard to figure out all the settings. Trial and error for me. Once set it was fine. My watch jammed. I could not get anything to change. Nothing. This was about less than a year use. Have it but never tried to have it fixed. What I liked was the large numbers and letters. Easy to read and everything one could want comprised on one large face. You can change it just to the time. I like the way it is presented on Amazon. If you have a small wrist pass on it. If you have a large wrist and don't mind the weight it is worthy of consideration. Low pricing was why I got mine from Amazon., Horrible quality. I found many things going wrong after a while., I recently bought this watch for my teenager but when she picked up to wear it to her school today, the watch had stopped working 6 days ago!!! the date in the watch is Aug 21st and the watch is not working at all. This is the first time I have experienced with Amazon that I had bought a product through them and the product did not work. I am living in the Bahamas and I don't know how to get this fixed., Very cute but the band wrinkled after the first wear ... still working but crappy band..you get what you pay for, OWESOME WATCH I LIKE THE WAY THEY DESIGNED IT AND I LIKE THE COLOR COMBINATION TOO, THIS WACTH WAS ELEGANT, This watch is like a part of my body., amazing wrist piece, I am a huge rolex fan and this watch has completed my collection., I received this watch today and it is just beautiful in person.  The only problem is that the clasp links are so tight that it is almost impossible to open to put on your wrist.  I even posted a question on line thinking I was doing something wrong.  After working for a long time, I finally got one of them to pop open using a screwdriver and a lot of force.  I have been opening and closing it hoping it will loosen up or it is going to be tough to take off my wrist without assistance.  But, other than the tight clasp, it is a beautiful watch and worth the dollars., This is so much better than the rubber watch bands that always break., I thought the gold looked cheep, however, I have this watch in silver and love it.  Vendor accepted my return without issue., This watch is incredibly difficult to change sizes.  It also feels very cheaply made.  The metal finish came off when I was removing the plastic protector that it came with.  Clearly a cheap knock off made in China.  Don't recommend...spend an extra $10-$20., trusted seller. watch was perfect, This watch is actually a lot more petite than I expected. I definitely need my glasses to see the numbers so I could see where this wouldn't be large enough for some people to read easily. I'm 125lbs and had no problem getting this to fit on my wrist. Works great for my job as an EMT. Has the elapsed time dial as well as the date. Has lasted through blood, water rescues, and frequent hand washings so I'm happy. It does tend to absorb color from any fabrics it comes into contact with. Still, I would definitely buy this again. It's a good watch for the price., pink and white makes the watch look feminine but hip..., Broke right away, Very sturdy watch. I bought when teaching P.E in the Marshall Islands, as I needed a watch for class. So its life was spent in a salty, very humid environment where I was quite active and sweating. I also did a lot of free diving, and wore this watch every time down to depths of 70 feet.<br />It never got in the way, and the rotating bezel was great for keeping a lap time.<br />After about a year, the battery quit which, I realize, may vary depending on shelf time, but other than that it is still with me. Now the band started wearing, and has since broken, but for the stress it received, I am impressed.<br />For the price, it is worth it to buy another watch and have a backup, instead of dealing with a new band.<br />Just ordered a new one myself., This has been my best watch.  Very accurate and comfortable to wear.  Size and weight not an issue,  Very legible day and night., I arrived item thank you, Difficult to connect to smart phone. It's ok, but what can be expected for $18.00? If anything fails, it's a cheap watch, My hand keeps hitting the buttons changing the fact. Irritating, the other model with small silver buttons did not have this problem. Otherwise good., The watch is solidly built, which from my experience is common with Seikos. The chapter ring lines up accurately. The dial is a slightly lighter shade of orange than the chapter ring, which is kind of annoying but I guess it's a trade off for being solar powered. The worst part of this watch is the position of the crown, which rubs on the top of my hand while being worn. Haven't gotten it wet and don't plan to, but I'm not concerned with the water resistance of this watch, as Seiko divers are usually top notch when it comes to that. Lume is great after being exposed to light and lasts a decent amount of time. The band it comes with is comfortable (for me, your experience may differ) and looks great in contrast to the dial. I don't like when the metal bracelets pull the hairs on my arm., The second hand broke off 2 months after purchase., It is really small, and the band is really thin and cheap, it is not what I expected as I purchased a similar one last year and the band was longer and more durable/sturdy. I do not recommend for anyone over the age of 10, I have a Stuhrling watch I purchased earlier and since I liked it so much I decided to buy one with another color band and face.  The band on this watch is a bit narrower and seems out of proportion with the watch face. It is a very nice looking watch and this may not bother some people., It's not made well broke the first time I wear it. But it is cute I will say that and it looks just like the pic., My wife loved it. It's the style she likes an fulfilled her spectations. She liked its light weight., Very nice watch, but if you are a larger than the catalog models, this won't fit your wrist. That's a bit sad as most people I'm acquainted with are larger than me. On the last hole of the band, it was still uncomfortable to wear., Looks better in person!!, Best automatic watch you can buy for the money. There's a reason this basic design has been around for so long - it's an excellent, durable, handsome watch., owned it 3 months already had to replace battery not happy., Really not a great product. The punches are too big to get watch links out. The link resizer isn't large enough for a 23mm band.so you have to take it out and use it as a punch anyways... Cheap tools. But 8 bucks and I was able to resize two of my watches., Fantastic! It looks even better than the picture. Arrived promptly and was safely packaged. It didn't come with a case, but that's understandable (less than $50 watch) I mean come on. Those who complain about not being able to set the date, it's not a big deal. Just wind the clock forward until the date changes. And this has to be done once a month. Small price to pay for such a great looking watch for such a low price. The band quality is superb. It is rigid at first, but once you work it and break it in (1-3 days), it becomes soft and takes the contour of your wrist flawlessly.<br /><br />In conclusion, the only gripe is the lack of a case, which is to be expected for the price. Band is sturdy, soft, and complements the red clock hands. The face is not too large and is intriguing because of the small magnifier for the date. I would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't want an overly large watch yet one that draws attention while simultaneously being subtle., Really simple, classic, quality watch. Good size face and beautifully crafted. It's a bit flatter than expected but this is good. Most of the trendier watches worn today are fat and heavy. Really unnecessary really considering it's used to tell time rather than anchor a boat. I feel comfortable with a Seiko knowing their long tradition as solid watch makers., I have a small collection of watches, and this was a great addition.  I got this watch because it was a lightning deal, and it matched the school colors where I work.  It is a very nice looking watch.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pins for removing links.  I have a link remover tool, but it doesn't work with the pins in this watch.  I was able to size the watch myself, but it wasn't as easy as it would have been if it had standard pins in it., Very Disappointed.  This watch failed to pair with my Galaxy Note 2 and Galaxy Note 4 phone.  It would complete the pairing process and it would show identical pin numbers for pairing, but each attempt resulted in a message that the pin could not be confirmed.  I tried every variation I could find on the internet (there were a lot of issues and solutions listed there for pairing problems with the Moto 360).  I made my attempts in two different network environments (work and home) using two different phones.  Each phone completed all the pairing steps as designed and produced a pin that matched on each unit.  BUT THE FINAL MESSAGE ALWAYS STATED THESE IDENTICAL PINS DID NOT MATCH  I saw the number over 20 to 30 attempts and the pin numbers always matched and the message always failed to confirm the process.  I returned the unit to Amazon and did not request a replacement., Excellent quality. Easy on., Just as described. Installed by hand and held up to multiple attempts.  Contacted seller regarding previous purchase. Seller was courteous and prompt with refund. Pay attention to dimensions to avoid ordering the wrong size, Trust me,,, it's an eye catcher,,,,,, after one month, watch will not keep time, save your money 😤, Awesome, Nice cheap watch, that looks really good. Basically a generic low priced pocket watch with a quartz movement (uses batteries).<br /><br />The cover art is very good with a deeper than expected relief and very sharp detail.  The watch face is fairly plain with stylized Arabic numerals for hours and minutes/seconds. The hands are of a fine filigree. The back has a floral decoration.<br /><br />The Cyrillic writing translates as &#34;Saint Petersburg&#34;. The ship depicted is the Russian Cruiser &#34;AURORA&#34; a 1900 vintage  Pallada class Cruiser.  It is a historic ship that is currently on display in that city.<br /><br />The watch itself  works fine and can be found on a popular auction site for about half the total price paid here., very pretty looking watch! different than anything I have seen so far! I love it! you can't beat the price!, this is the best in a series of 6 or so Casio watches and it's the best so far., OKAY, Most of my watches are huge... over 67 millimeters ...you call them big face watches, and this case held them all. I couldn't  find a single thing wrong with is product. The red stiching on the pillow was amazing and perfectly done. The lock works...it's of great quality.  The seller shipped it fast and I would buy from them again. Very pleased., My daughter really likes this watch, and the coloration.  Thats really the main attraction here, because the watches functions are very common and basic.  Its true that you can use the stopwatch to &#34;train&#34; with but there is hardly a digital watch that doesn't.  So, when you are buying this item, I think you should mostly be looking to see if they hit the aesthetics right.  For my daughter, it is great.  She is very pleased with the color and it works well enough., you are such liars!!! my watch is fake...it doesnt have the michael kors stamp at the back.. liars!!!!, it does not work!, It's a beautiful watch,  I love the stainless with the white ceramic.  The clasp is a little complicated to take off but other than that no complaints., Sent to me with a dead battery, have had this watch before, until I wore it out.  Glad to get another one, LIKE IT, This is a great watch for work.  It is comfortable,  I have a small wrist, it fits me fine.  I especially like the light, I can check my watch at night, I wear glasses and can see the dial fine without my glasses., Watch was mans size. Too big for lady. Returned it., it looked fine but it was not wide enough.  Contacted the seller to see if they had something wider and their response was to just say send it back., The item starts rusting the hence not rated well, Hate it! My wrists are small and its usually hard to find watches that fit without looking too bulky, but the watch is way too small. Don't buy it unless your giving it to a baby or a barbie., I bought this very affordable watch on the spur of the moment. Since then, I've received TONS of compliments on it from several different people, including strangers. What I love most about it is that you can go online to search for 20mm canvas watch bands and there are many, many color options your can order for like $5 each, that easily slide into this watch. The process could not be simpler, as there's no pin removal or tools required. I bought a black/red band, and a navy/red band to swap out from this blue/white one., COOL, Cheap material... Broke with a week.... No shipping info was given, so I had to check the mail daily hoping to finally get it for a few weeks.... Not made for men's size wrist... For woman or young adults ok, Screen is tremendously fragile for the price of this watch. I'd read some reviews on a watch by the same company about how easily the screen cracked, and hoped that it wouldn't be the case with this watch as well. Unfortunately no- it lasted about 4 days of regular wear, but when I took it off on the last day and set it down on my wooden dresser the screen cracked right down the center! Without any rough treatment at all. I am very disappointed with the quality of the watch considering how much it costs-the screen is far too thin and is an irresponsible of the seller. You could probably get something as cute at Target for $20 that would last years longer., I'm giving the watch 5 stars because the construction of it is very solid. It really seems to be a terrific watch all around for the price. But, unfortunately, I'll be returning it. My fault really, I should have taken the time to convert the centimeters to inches regarding the watch face. I relied on the images and it's larger than it looks in the those; truly a mans' size. Chuckle....I feel like I'm wearing a large print watch except I'm not old enough to need that!<br /><br />I like watches the same as I like eyeglasses....light and barely there. If the face had been smaller it would have worked for me., Box came open with no instructions., Very feminine watch. I love the faceted crystal and the color. Easy to tell the time.  Only problem was trying to figure out how to adjust it. I googled it and found how to do it on YouTube! I've seen this watch on another website and Amazon had a fantastic price!, Looks good. Lighter weight than my other Victorinox. The band was extremely long., I ordered a black one and what i recieved is gray. Am so disappointed, Wouldn't say that this is the poor man's rolex or anything.... but I do offer this analogy:<br />Crawfish is to lobster as Orient is to Tag Heuer. If you are anything like me then you would understand that crawfish(orient) is just as delicious and versatile at a fraction of the price of lobster(Tag) Don't like my analogy?... well then you must've been shaken as a baby. BUT believe me when I say you really can't go wrong with this watch. It's classy enough to dress up, it's casual enough to wear every day and water resistant to boot, Maybe for more tech-minded folks this watch would work for them.  However, my husband and I found the instructions confusing. (We both are university educated so it shouldn't have been so hard.) It might be a great product, we just couldn't figure out how to get it to work.  Finally my husband just tossed it in the trash bin because he got so frustrated by it., the product is too old, let me feel too disappointed,why not a new watch? it's too bad, Will not set to proper time. None of the features work. Wish I had skipped!, Good watch. Blue band on crown fell of one of the first few times I wore it., I wanted a basic and inexpensive watch and that's exactly what I got. The band of the watch was bent upon arrival., Complete garbage. The dials are just nonfunctional spinning hands. Not worth even the 4 bucks., Very Nice Watch. Even though it is an automatic  I find that I need to wind it occasionally. It is a terrific watch for the money., Nice watch for the money.  One issue I have is thin black hands on a black dial make it next to impossible to read the time unless you are in direct sun light., For the money can't go wrong., I loved the hardware on this strap (the matte black clasp is awesome) but the leather felt a little cheap and the strap was way too long. I ended up sending it back and getting another strap from StrapsCo., very good looking ,Swiss made and automatic movement watch, for  affordable price.Royal blue looks awesome., The watch design is magnificent but it came with a dead battery. This made me very disappointed with the purchase because it was a gift to my husband. If it wasn't for this problem, it would have gotten a higher rating., Band is tight/short for my wrist - I'll replace the band and keep the watch for my work!, Seems well built enough I have only had it for a day or two so I can't say much as far as durability, but note; it DID NOT come with new spring bars, and has a slight blueish tint to it... kind of a gun metal blue... if that is what you are looking for then perfect, I was looking for more of a GREY GREY... my watch face was blue so it works well for me., This watch is gorgeous. I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. It doesn't need a battery! The face is blue crystal and my favorite part is that you can see all the cogs and wheels working! It's got a nice, big face. A manly but pretty watch. I wish they made a girl one like it., My wife bought me this watch for our 20th anniversary and I absolutely love it.  I own many Invicta watches and I prefer the bigger ones and this bad boy is big!  You will feel this on your wrist. I am a big guy so this doesn't really have an effect on me but if you are of a smaller build then this watch will let you know that you are wearing it.  I will say that even though this is a bigger, heavier watch, the polyurethane band is &#34;softer&#34; and more flexible than most others I have seen and this makes the wear of this watch more comfortable., Beautiful watch. Haven't worn it yet because I have to adjust it to my wrist size but is a very good looking watch., I was surprised to find how much I love this watch. It's super simple, keeps time well, and it's a lot prettier in person than it is in the photos. This is my new go-to watch for casual wear. I'm not normally a fan of digital watch aesthetics, but the convenience has won me over. The time, date, and day are so easy to read at a glance. The illumination works well too. And thanks to the low price, I can wear it carefree. It barely costs more than a fresh battery for my other watches. I'm genuinely impressed., This watch is so pretty in person. I can't believe the price. Definitely doesn't look cheap at all! Love it., Beautiful product with great shipping. I'm absolutely in love with my new watch! Would definitely recommend as a gift for someone, My wife has been looking for a watch with an alarm and an illuminated display. Most of the &#34;sport&#34; watches are large and clunky, but not this Armitron. The watch body is considerably smaller than the typical sport watch and the teal band color is softer than it appears on my monitor - my wife likes it a lot.<br /><br />This watch packs a LOT of features, which also means that the controls are a bit complicated. There are four buttons which get pressed in various combinations. A detailed instruction leaflet is included, but if you're over 30 you may need a magnifying glass to read it. There were some features we really liked:<br /><br />- You can set a second time zone (though the day indicator doesn't show in the T2 mode.) You get to this mode by pressing the lower left button four times. What is really nice is that if you set one of the three (!) alarms, you can specify which time zone it is for!<br />- As I mentioned, there are three alarms - these can be daily or weekly (on a specified day). The alarm sound is rather faint - my wife likes this, but if you need a loud alarm, this watch is not for you. There is also an hourly chime you can set.<br />- The stopwatch/chronograph mode has a split feature and you can also set a countdown timer<br />- The illumination is gentle - it doesn't light the entire face - and fades out after three seconds<br /><br />The watch is waterproof to 100 meters (330 feet), as long as you don't press any buttons., The pouch is exactly what I was looking for - it perfectly fits an electronic banking token I use! It means I can have the token in my pocket or bag without worrying that I might be accidentally pressing buttons..., Guys, it is awesome. I like it :) best price for luxury watch. Thank u amazon :), Just what I was looking for!....nice size, great for everyday wear!  Band is easily adjustable, face is easy to read...very happy with my purchase, Fades, not adjustable, This product is crap, no useless pairings tearing from time to time with the iPhone money waste Casio really disappointing, Excellent & Classy, You may need to get the links adjusted to size, mine is too big for my wrist, Larger than I thought it would be.  But a nice looking time piece., Is execellet, Came in broken, looks fake also. I have to return back to china for almost $30 in order to get my refund. I don't recommend., My favorite G-Shock. The black on black on black look is killer, the watch decently small (unlike the other huge Men's G-Shocks), and it is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time., It looks good but there are better WR 200m watches from similar value or less. I sold it., It's a sturdy reliable watch that I wear when running, jogging, or walking.  Can't mess with a good ol' Casio!, Very sturdy and comfortable at the same time, Beside the weight, I would recommend it.  I got a lot of nice feedback from my friends., I use it for the beach., Love this little time keeper. Had one before this one and I have always wanted to another after it unfortunatly broke. Can't beat the price., OKAY, Awesome. Shipped quickly, Very nice watch. I returned mine because I had actually ordered a different model (12011) and paid $70, but this is what came in the package. Seeing how this watch is about $40, I retuned it to get the watch I had originally ordered. Its a beautiful watch and a good size. Not too small, not too large. A clean classic look., Awesome watch. The weight is what makes it better. Be prepared to shorten the belt though., I ordered this watch for my Dads birthday and I this watch is amazing, I had my doubts but it's a wonderful watch., cool watch, good size, easy instructions, Best gift you can give to your wife 🌹, The watch does not keep time properly, once the pendulum stops moving the watch dosent work the buttons and knobs are really lose specially the one on the upper left that controls the numbers, the date month and day skip, the watch is big and very poorly built, I was expecting a well-built watch and I also read the majority of the comments thinking that it was going to be a good watch unfortunately when it arrived I was very disappointed. I rather have less features and a watch well-built than to have a watch that doesn’t work at all. YUP, Really nice, very high quality replacement band. Soft and very comfortable, stainless clasp is thick and also of very high quality for the money. The  22 mm band gives the watch a bit more beef to the design, doesn't slip or move on your wrist. Very Happy with the purchase. Replacing the band is super easy, you need a small precision screwdriver size 1.4 mm then unscrew and pull out the rest of the way. You can view how too on YouTube. Thanks, I am  not sure what some of the people are taking about with the negative feed back but I have a few $10k watches I got this unit and I have not had one hiccup with it. I am a Firefighter and I wear this watch everyday that I work and it always looks great and runs perfect., very satisfied., I purchased this for my dad, to replace one I had previously given him. It is very comfortable and easy to read, he loves it., Exactly as advertised, Face is a little smaller than I wanted, but it works. Good for yatching or some other semi-casual activity., I am an avid watch collector and have my share of complications, chronos, etc...  After taking a breather and surveying what I own, I decided I should add to my dress watch collection, something clean, classic and slim to wear with my suits.  And I found this one.  I thought I would be disappointed when this arrived because it is missing all the bells, whistles and buttons of the others.  Instead, it has become one of my favorites to wear.  Beautifully made, sleek and elegant.  Also has a 1950s aura to it.  I am now looking for more Zenith Elite Ultra Slims and I think you should too but not before I buy my next one., Great watch for the price! I agree with some of the other reviewers when they said that the watch is like a children's watch. I would say quality wise it pretty much is similar to a children's watch. And it seems to be small. However I still like it and wear it daily., The band is small ,it seems like it's more for a kid instead of a mans watch ,but it fit so I keep it ,I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it .this is the second or third Casio watch I have bought from amazon and they are great watches., Great watch, got it as a gift for my husband who was always breaking watch bands.  Rugged, kind of sexy, not too flashy, but still a bit of Harley charm., This is a beautiful watch. I love it except for the fact that the band is too long. Maybe I have exceptionally thin wrists, but I have it fastened on the last hole and I can still fit two fingers between the band and my wrist. There are 8 holes for making the band looser, which I can't believe very many women have wrists that big.I wish I could get a smaller band., The watch that was sent to me didn't work.  Also, it looks like it has been used.  What a waste of time!  Now I have to return it and I don't have a watch to use., This is very nice casual watch, the face is very heavy and strudy, easy to set time as well. The wrist band stitching is red and looks a bit less casual or just not as elegant as the watch. The face is super large as well., Very pleased with the watch.  It looks stylish, keeps excellent time and the light weight is a real bonus., I'm absolutely head over heels for this watch. It has a cute little box to be kept in and the watch looks really expensive. Haven't had time with it yet but its really lovely., Took forever to get it, absolutely beautiful watch. I bought this watch for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she loves it. Everything she was looking for from the rose gold to the roman numerals and the white leather band. A very fine quality watch., TIMEX Women's T2H492 Easy Reader. I like this watch a lot. My TIMEX watches have always done better than all my other brand-name watches., bought it for my son.  he likes the quality and look., I like my watch! Thank You!, Best watch for the price in my opinion. Very reliable movement., Great watch!  I wear it everyday. Don't get it if you have bad or blurry eyes as the details of the watch are very small.  Might want to look for something easier to read or something digital. But good for normal eyes., This is my second watch of this style!!! My other watch runs good but the band broke. My husband bought me another watch instead of a band because of price!!!, Awesome. Thank you.., Awesome looking watch, makes a fashion statement., Best watch value ever! Handsome and experienced all features advertised!<br />Can't  believe the price!, worked perfectly, exact replacement, This is a great choice for a metal G-Shock. It wears big, but the way the bracelet attaches to the lugs makes it fit much better than my G-Shock with the resin strap. One interesting feature of the metal bracelet is that the removable links are connected by spring bars rather than pins. I don't know whether that makes it easier or harder to size, but a couple of spring bars did hit the ceiling while I was sizing the band. The digital displays provide the right amount of extra information to the analog hands and make it more user-friendly than the analog-only choices. The solar charging works well, and the only feature this model is missing is the multi-band radio signal reception. I have to think it was originally designed to include multi-band since the pusher at 4 o'clock is labeled &#34;search,&#34; and there's absolutely no function on this watch where &#34;search&#34; would describe what that pusher accomplishes. The metal bezel makes it look a lot better than the rubber or resin bezels you're used to seeing on G-Shocks, and the face is nicely proportioned to the overall size of the watch, where it sometimes looks undersized on other models., Complete garbage!!!<br />The band literally broke before I could even get a chance to put it on, I returned as I have not liked this much., I wear this watch to work at a doctors office.  I receive compliments whenever I wear it., The watch itself has a clean nice look to it, however it felt very small on my wrist. I figured I'd give it a few days to see if it would grow on me, but while at work the hand movements about drove me insane. They are very loud if you work in a quiet environment. I couldn't take it anymore and returned it. I just feel there are other watches in same price range that are much nicer (and quieter), such as many of the Lucien Piccard watches. That's what I ended up going with instead and the quality feels far superior to this Timex (even though they make a lot of great watches)., I was super disappointed when I received this watch. I love batman and wanted an inexpensive digital watch to wear to work that was also kids sized because I have abnormally tiny wrists. I originally purchased one of these at burlington coat factory and returned it when I realized that the top button (the one that makes it flash) had fallen out. I then decided to buy it here on amazon because it was about $5 cheaper and it would be less likely to have missing parts. When I received it, the flashed worked and all buttons were there but the time display didn't work. I tried doing every combination of the different buttons that I could think of and the different combinations that were on the instructions but it still wouldn't work. I even opened up the back to try taking out the batteries and replace them but that didn't work either. Ended up getting a refund for my money. Amazon let me keep the watch even after refunding me, but now I have no idea what I'm going to do with a watch that doesn't display time and only flashes., Exactly as pictured and super cute.<br /><br />Might buy other colors :-), The watch band is flimsy, itchy plastic to stiff to wear comfortably. Even as a cheap watch, it's not worth the money., Outstanding service! Fits my watch perfectly and saves me from buying a new watch just because the band fell apart., Love the watch, easy to read, fits wonderfully!, Just as described. Very nice piece. My opinion is that it is both dressy and casual. And the face is big enough that I can read it without having to find my reading glasses!<br /><br />Update: I've had the watch for about 7 months now and this is my &#34;everyday&#34; watch. The face still looks perfect, but gold tone has worn off of a good portion of the band, especially the side that rests/rubs on my desk. Most of that side of the band looks silver now, with a portion of it being worn further and it looks to be copper underneath. I still love the style and am currently looking for something similar that will be more durable., too small for my wrist, too cheap to be worth the trouble of returning it, Be careful, I really needed a slightly smaller size.  I used a razor blade to cut a tiny piece off each side to make it fit.  Looks good., Very comparable to the Suunto core black, but wears much smaller with a better bracelet. The bracelet does use solid pins with a tiny insert in the center section of the link, so if you're not comfortable working with tiny pieces, you might want to have this sized by a professional. The bracelet is also much more narrow, particularly on the back side. While the photo shows the seconds counting around the outside of the dial, there is no ability to actually select that display on this watch (although the Suunto does have that as an option). The compass &#34;pointer&#34; moves around the outside of the display there, but not the seconds. Overall, there are fewer display options than the Suunto, but it mirrors all of the core functions. Two aspects that are superior to the Suunto are the sapphire crystal and the solar charging. If you're going to get an all-digital ProTrek, this is one to choose., Purchased this watch last month, I loved the way it looked, feminine and so delicate. This is a beautiful watch, and very made, the only thing is I have a small wrist and have to find someone to take off some links., Exceeded my expectations. Big face and lots of cool features., Simple. Has all the necessary functions. Cheap., the watch face/size is actually way too small for my taste; and for my eyes! I can hardly read what time it is... : (, Great watch horrible band. The band wouldn't latch out of the box. but it keeps good time and is nice looking., Fits my Pebble Watch perfect! High quality, will take time to break in... More later on., This watch is so nice!! You can use it while dressed casual or all dressed up. Every time I wear it I get lots of compliments. And the price? 10 stars!!, Not as quality as pic..but ok, Very chip, Very attractive and made well, Looks more expensive than it was, Longest pin was not long enough for need., I would have gave it a 6 star but the latch has issues.  The little squeeze latch doesn't work.  The final latch is all that's holding it on., armitron watches are very reliable and long lasting. Worth for the price paid, Adorable watch! recommend to all,, I time my most important medication with the count down feature. I time my walking with the stop watch feature. The alarm feature is very good. I like the imposing manly look.<br /><br />I had a similar watch for years. I rendered it useless trying to replace the battery., Omg I love this watch. It's big and beautiful. I highly recommend this watch. Must have, Awesome watch!!!, This watch would be a good deal at twice the price. I would give it 8 stars if I could. I have dress watches I spent over $150 on that I don't like as much as this watch., Little to small for what I expected., Extra metal look and feel stupid., Stopped working about after a month, A bit stiff, but it will break in in time.  Perfect fit., The watch is great, except I ordered the purple one, not the light blue one that came.  Other than that, the watch is as described and seems to keep good time.  I figured it was more trouble to return it than keep a different color., Ok, original strap has low quality but watch is fair and accurate, Face scratches easily and it permanent., Really like it but wish it was a tad smaller, I absolutely love my new watch. I was looking for something casual that I was able to wear everyday.  My Fossil watch was it.  Thank you!  Susan, It is pretty but the white on the band keeps peeling off. I won't wear it because of that., Good looking, heavy, and too large for my wrist, but I really like this watch so I'll take to a repair shop to have some links removed.  It has more bells and  whistles than my Cartier Tank  and it's great for international travel as it has the times and dates of cities worldwide available at a glance.  No, it can't count calories nor steps taken,but I don't consider that  to be a minus because, it's quite easy to switch to a pedometer type device when you reach your destination.  All in all, a fine timepiece that does what a watch is supposed to do, tell time accurately., I never received it.. Glad it was cheap, Had the watch for about a week. Stopped working and band broke all in the same day!!!, My wife is very pleased with this watch.<br /><br />., Gets compliments almost every day I wear it. Very  attractive watch., Purchased as a gift and my son can't be happier. Arrived before the scheduled date looks good enough I'm gonna order the red one, Better then I expected., It looked olive green when I first wanted to order it and it was gray but it still looks very nice so we  kept the watch., Perfect thank you, Awesome watch. But its big. I'm 6' 3&#34; 220 lbs and its slightly heavy on my wrist but if you like bigger watches its a steal, Great ! Well done ! The watch is the best in amazon :) nice price !! Thank u amazon..., Excellent condition, perfect!, fatt risk, Very elegant, I got a f***ING coin holder., This watch is absolutely amazing, got it as a present and I am totally in love with it, very beautiful and elegant especially for small wrests like me. Will recommend for friends, Perfectly described, fast delivery, awesome price! 110% satisfied!, They got me on this one!!! My mottow has always been, you get what you pay for! This is crap!! Buttons don't work to set the damn thing, and it always scrolling something!! Into the trash it goes! Could have used that money to buy a beer!! Pissed off!!, Just what I wanted.  and exactly as described, I bought these because I wanted to have a nice set of watches but not drop serious coin on them. They're alright, the watch with days of the week on it the finish has started to rub off (after not much wear) and the stainless steel is somewhat noticeable and the other watch I really haven't worn because the chain is kind of clunky and moves around a lot. Honestly the box they came in was my favorite thing about this amazon item., quit working faster than expected. but like the bangle bracelet, Stopped working within 2 months and one of the ceramic links cracked. Is always 30 minutes off no matter how many times I adjust it. Within a day it's off again, Strap wore out in less than a year and isn't covered by warranty, This watch is simple, elegant, and has kept perfect time for me so far. I receive a lot of compliments on it., The watch has a good weight to it and the face size of about 44mm is big enough to be worn by people with wider wrists.<br />The face can seem to be a little busy, but I like the blue hands.  The clasp deployment has never opened when I was using it.<br />Day date and time has been running well and accurately.  I have my doubts on actually using this for swimming.<br />This is comparable to Invicta watches, who makes watches that takes inspiration from higher end watches.  The price of less than two hundred dollars is fair, anything over that I would think twice., VERY NICE WATCH.  KEEPS GOOD TIME.  I HAVE A SKIN ALLERGY AND ANY WATCH I WEAR BREAKS ME OUT AFTER A FEW DAYS.  I MM SURE THIS WATCH WILL TOO.  NO FAULT OF THE WATCH.  I LIKE IT AND WOULD RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE., Terrific old school watch, probably my favorite., Have had so many compliments., less than a week, the pin connecting the watch to the bracelet already broke., The watch is attractive and lightweight. The pictures are quite accurate. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 * is that I  the strap feels cheaply constructed. I've only worn the watch for two days so I don't know how it will hold up., Nice watch but face is larger than it appears in picture., My first bulova watch its is my favorite. Im a big guy and this watch looks good on me. Is has a elegant look., Stopped working after a month!, On third one ... love the design, but the product is defective or &#34;old&#34; dead battery stock is being sent instead of a truly &#34;new&#34; watch.<br /><br />Amazon credited a defective unit (thanks!) that literally fell apart (plastic housing separated from the body of the watch).<br />Backcountry refunded a &#34;new&#34; watch, 5 days after receipt, that had an issue with the back-light not working (dead battery?).<br />I'm using the 3rd one, but the back-light is so dim as to be unusable. Tired of sending these back so will keep it.<br /><br />Soleus, get your act together. Provide local dealers that can replace the batteries and seal., The watch looks great and has the quality that I have come to expect from Stuhrling. The instructions to set the day/date are a little general but you get the idea how to set the watch. The leather watch band is very heavy duty and should last a long time. I'm very pleased with the watch. It looks as good at home as it did online., l like..., After two uses it started to come apart!, Ok, First one lasted 3 weeks., Very confusing to set times and date!, COOL, Amazing watch! The gears and mechanisms look amazing, the crystal is tough, and tbe design is very flashy. But this watch does have one minor downfall which is its LOUD movements. It is a very loud watch and can hard to sleep to you have it on display in your room. If you can get past the loud ticking, then its a great watch!, Like the look of this watch - have had several earlier models of the G Force watch.<br /><br />Could not get the blue tooth synchro to work with my iPhone or Samsung phone.<br /><br />Would not buy this watch with my experience now., The Armitron Sport Women's Clear Jelly Strap Digital Watch is comfortable, attractive, and easy to set.  It has a stainless-steel back, an acrylic case, and displays the time in a large, bold font.  There are some features that could be a bit more user-friendly.  Although the day and date appear on the watch face, you can access the month only by pushing a button on the side.  This is not a big problem, since most of us know the month without glancing at our watches. What is strange is that the words Monday through Friday are printed in tiny letters, and the current day of the week is blacked out.<br /><br />Since I do not make a habit of exposing my watch to water, I cannot comment on its water-resistance. However, I would advise being gentle with the strap, since it is made of a resin-type plastic.  If you force the strap or make it too tight, the loop could conceivably break. I wear the Armitron a bit looser than necessary in order to reduce wear and tear.  The price is reasonable for this sporty and extremely lightweight timepiece that is practical for everyday use., This is my second time buying this watch, I got the first one in Europe and that lasted for years so I decided to buy a new one from amazon. After two months of careful usage today I saw there is steam in the watch, I didn't even go into the water, I just went to the beach where it is a little bit more humid than the city and this happened. I will be contacting the company for warranty.. I will be updating my review after talking to them.., favorite watch out of many, many., Love this watch!  It keeps perfect time and is just the right size for a man with a somewhat more slender wrist. Stylish and quality made., Great watch for the money. Made really nice and strap is perfect for my skinny wrist. still ticking after two days of not wearing it. I would recommend this watch to everyone out there., A gift, so not totally certain how it is being used or enjoyed, but seemed to be a hit on his birthday., 2 reviews and 5 stars? Seems legit., Very pretty, I needed an analog watch with a second hand that wasn't too flashy, or drew too much attention. I didn't want to spend a lot of money so that when it broke or became contaminated, it could be tossed without too much grief. After reading the reviews (some good, some terrible), I decided to give it a shot. The watch arrived on time well packaged and ticking. The chapter ring is perfectly lined up with the numbers. The dial is very readable, with large bright white numbers and day of week and day displayed.  The watch itself is fully plastic except for the backing which is stainless steel, so it is very light weight, as I often forget I am wearing it, and the band is very comfortable. The bezel, which does not have lumed numbers, rotates in both directions with a gliding motion, as opposed to clicking (which I prefer). While wearing it one day, I did noticed that the day of the week was stuck between days  (which is a majority of the complaints of the other reviews). I adjusted it with the crown (which does not screw down, just pushes and pulls in and out). So far is has not happened again since that day.The lume brightness and intensity of the lume is the weakest point of this watch. After being outdoors in a sunny day with it, the dial didn't light up at all. As a test (but mostly out of boredom) I shone an LED flashlight on it for 1 minute; the lume barely reached an acceptable level of brightness, and was dark again in less than 2 minutes. I have not gotten it wet as of yet, so I can not attest to the water resistance. Overall a decent watch for 16ish bucks., I loved the watch, the crown pulled straight out once i went to readjust the time and shortly after the watch quit because of water. i would prob buy again just try again, Fitted this about a month ago, after the first strap gave up the ghost after 7 years of hard use. this should last just as long., Broke within a week! The light stopped working and time seemed to be off. It had a moisture bubble in it like water somehow got inside but I never wore it in the shower, tub, pool, rain... Could only have gotten in there from washing my hands... Lame sauce, does not fit correct, Title says black band, Specifications section says calfskin. It is black rubber/vinyl.  Watch itself is okay, so far., Watch is excellent--the band , not so much.  I used my old Casio band., Not happy with this watch.  I've owned several Timex watches and liked them.  The Indiglo light in this watch is too dim to read the watch.  The glow in  the dark feature only lasts a few minutes and the hands have holes in them so there's not enough phosphorescent material to read<br />This watch is pretty much useless in the dark., The background is a really pixelated picture...but you get what you pay for., beautiful watch, Very good quality for half the price of similar watches. I was apprehensive about purchasing this watch as the price was so low. Nice job Polo, I love this watch!, Nice watch for little money. Is not water proof though which is kind of a disappointment, Very nice bracelet, a perfect fit on my Seiko SKX007.  Easily adjusted, great quality., I bought this watch for my sister, the watch works perfect however it looks so cheap and I'm not sure how long it is going to last, probably a lot, probably not., Excellent, Really beautiful. Very happy with this purchase., This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He loves it!! He has few G-shocks already but none with the larger face so this was a great addition to his collection. The gray camo is very stylish., It works well a lot going on in the dial area., Wife loves that she can see the face to tell time.  Day/date too small for her to make out., I recently picked up this watch and the Navy Weekender Chrono. I really like them both - especially for the price. The outer bezel on this watch looks like a brushed chrome in the picture, it actually has a dark gray, almost black, look. The numbers and chronograph dials are cream colored, not a bad look, but don't get the idea that they are off-white. The one big drawback from this watch is the hands also being black with a thin line of cream - which feels lighter than the cream of the numbers. It sometimes is hard to tell what the time is if you only glance at the watch. I would change this either with some sort of white skeleton hands or arrows to make it easier to tell time. The other unusual thing is that the date numbers are in white, so with everything in a cream color it really can stick out. I am glad they chose to go with the dark background though, making it less noticeable.<br /><br />Also, the seconds hand for keeping time is in the dial above the 6, the seconds hand on the watch is for the chronograph function. That's a deal breaker for some people - not me - but be aware. I did change the band because I prefer a leather band, but the NATO was nice. It's on 20mm lugs, which is a nice size. The watch is overall is really nice, a great size for a chrono. It feels great, is good for those days when I feel like something different. The biggest thing is that this Weekender, and the navy, are a little thicker than the traditional Timex Weekender - but also DON'T have the audible ticking. That had turned me off to a lot of Timex watches - I haven't noticed with this one yet - even when listening for it., This watch is huge.  It's a little big for my taste, but I still enjoy wearing it.  I know Invicta makes larger watches, but I got it anyway.  It doesn't look ridiculous on my rather smallish wrist, but I had to take 7 links out I think to make it fit...haha I wanted a black watch, but not all black.  This watch was perfect.  The only thing I don't like about it is the redundant date.  It has a date window, and the bottom dial is the date as well.  I wish the bottom dial was for the hour on the timer function.  Other than that, its a great watch., Piece of crap. Stopped working after two months., l like..., I'm very disappointed concerning this watch it doesn't fit if your going to sell children's watches let the customer no, dissatisfied!, Sometime in the last 5 years they have degraded the quality of the watch.  With in the first week, the band fell off, the indigo duration is a fraction of what it used to be and after a brief period of use, the battery slowed and died.  Absolutely avoid this watch.  Granted it is cheap, but you will be frustrated with it, and ultimately spend additional money to replace it in short order.  Huge waste of money., I love this watch. I have small wrists, but it fits me fine.  I'm actually going back for another., Not as advertised, The watch died about 45 days after I got it. Could not return because of the 30 return policy.  I am deployed and was hoping for this watch to last longer. I did like the looks and feel., 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN HOW IT SEEMS TO BE, Worked perfectly!  Not exactly easy to install it on my old watch, but easier than I expected from reading the reviews, and way cheaper than a new watch.  Great deal for less than $9., Excellent Wacth!!!, This watch is not bad overall, and the price is right. But as some reviewers have said, getting the band to loosen up for adjustment is a real challenge. I followed the advice of other reviewers to read the documentation on it, and the closure was still so tight that popping it loose causes bending of the parts.<br /><br />If this thing had come with a regular leather band, I would have been fine with it. Now it doesn't want to stay clasped and tight, so I've given up and put in on the shelf., Watch functions great, but wrist band was too small. the wrist band should be larger., My wife loves this watch. Just the right amount of bling. Water resistant not waterproof., CHEAPLY MADE, BROKE WITHIN 2 MONTHS, Excellent Wacth!!!, I had to return this watch, it was too big for my wrist. Pay attention to it's 48mm size, 24mm band. It was huge. I really liked the face, it's a great looking chrono it's just very large. Had it not been as big, like my other Pulsar Chrono, I would have kept it., The only issue with this is the band, and there isn't any other type of band available for this watch. It is somewhat difficult to read as well., Fast delivery,like the watch, Cool for the price, Battery  was dead when i received  it. So it was NOT a deal, I received this watch, it does not work, contact the seller, he gave somethings to do even replacing the battery(in a brand new watch), I took it to a jeweler who told me the battery was more than the watch cost, very disappointed, very nice watch--can read it easily and the glo part works well at night---wish there was one like it that had military time, It is not a high quality product. Don't go by the HD pictures posted here. I bought it and returned it in less than 10 hours! The rear casing is like that of a 20$ China watch. Even the strap is rough kinda rough and is irritating when you wear it tight., i own many Invicta watches, this blue faced is beautiful!! Keeps time pretty accurate, for having the watch a little under 3 years...i have had my Rolex for 15 years, and it skips on time...a bit slow...on the seconds...but still a trooper!!! anyhow, the Invicta is definitely giving my Submariner a run for the $$$,, i bought this Invicta, because I love to take care and have all my really nicer watches show no sign of wear...Invicta....great Company, great products, great  Service!!, Nice simple watch nothing fancy I bought it for a work watch the price was good an I can read the numbers setting the time can be tricky so read the instructions carefully other than that I am satisfied, It is a very handsome watch and I like it very much but with a couple major complaints.  The numerals on the day display are VERY small and hard to see and the moving red dot that denotes the day of the week is also Very small and hard to see and not nearly as dramatic as it is in the picture display and was one of the main reasons I bought the watch.  The other reason is that Amazons price was lower by about $20 than any other place I found it for sale taking into account that it was a Amazon &#34;deal of the day&#34; item.  Overall, happy with the purchase., Very poor quality. But, it was very inexpensive, hard to see the Dials and buttons.. light is minimal and the WHITE fades quick and leaves black marks where it fades.. SUCKS cause i love the look of the watch .............so i still wear it LOL till the next one :), the watch arrived with one diamond missing. but sending it back was too much of a hassle, so i decided to keep them., I own several high end watches that cost several thousands of dollars and decided to take a chance on this Invicta.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a high quality good looking watch.  Chronograph works great and even counts 10th's of seconds for the first 30 seconds.  It is very comfortable to wear and the band is sturdy.  This watch comes off as high a quality level as my Monte Blanc's  and Tissot's of similar design.  the online photos do not do it justice.  It came in a high end case and had plastic film covering the crystal and metal case surfaces.  Even the metal inserts on the band were wrapped in plastic.  Will definitely buy Invicta again over much more expensive brands.  Incredible value and quality for the price!!!!, Beautiful watch. I will look to see if it comes in other colors. Recommend watch for both men & women, not too big, not too small., SO COOL, It does not look anything like the picture., Came 2-3 weeks early, nothing broken, same thing as retailed, not more to ask for, cheap bands, Works well., Good item ! Looks very nice !! Fast ship !!  Thank you, Item arrived and was scratched in numerous places.  It did not appear to be brand new and looks as if it had been used., Perfect for the price, Looks just like the picture and I adore the band. Size is perfect, Much bigger in size than I expected. (SEE PICTURE!!!)<br /><br />I feel like I need to wear a fat gold chain with giant emblems on it to wear this watch. The face is flat, and the glass (also flat) is so far from the face that I feel like a tiny metal ball should in there so I can try to roll it into the hole. If I was walking through the desert I would store my last 40 drops of water in the face of this watch., This is a very quiet clock and the black face with white hands and numbers makes it easy to see in the middle of the night., It reminds me of Gardner to remind me of were I've been, were am I now and were will I be... :), I ´m happy with this purchase!!! BEAUTIFUL WATCH!!!, Got this as a gift for my wife. Solidly built with comfortable leather strap. The 24 hour clock does take some getting used to but she loves it! A win for both of us., I'm a busy college student and this is the perfect watch. It's smaller than I perceived in the picture, however, I'm not disappointed. It matches everything that I wear which makes it the perfect watch for someone not interested in having an extensive selection to decide from in the morning. Also, I can finally tell someone what the date is when they ask with this handy, little watch's date keeper!, Really cool watch with a lot of cool functions, only complaint is that the digital is hard to see in low light environments, other than that I'm pretty satisfied., Beautiful, not too big. not too small. has chronometer, alarms, light, waterproof and I found it at a good price. It was delivered on time also. Big,clear display., Like watch.  Easy to read face, but loose around wrist., The watch is quite lovely and very much resembles the picture.  Unfortunately, it is a little  big, even after removing the extra links; I have small wrists.  Despite the size issue, I still wear and enjoy the watch., This is a beautiful watch... Very classy and elegant. There are multiple links that you can remove to adjust the size. I'm happy I purchased it!, Excelent, Have had one for the last six years and the band finally gave way., The watch has never run since I got it.  I will return it., Very convenient features, easy to press buttons, bright night-time illumination. However I haven't yet asked the question about statement not to press buttons under water. Does that mean also when wet?, as discribed., while not as well made as my previous band, it does the trick. Easy to install, I've had many Timex Ironman watches, all very functional. This one is a bit &#34;dressier&#34;--narrower strap, classier face (diamond shaped), lighter than usual color. It's somewhere between a work-a-day watch and a dress-up watch. It definitely has a place in my wardrobe. The only thing I wish I had known before I purchased it is that parts of the face have a shiny chrome-like finish--unexpected, but I'm getting used to it., UNBELIEVABLE VALUE FOR THE WATCH., Robust waterproof watch with a sporty appearance., Love the retro look, small size, and solar power, but I wish the band weren't as stiff - will take some time to break in.<br /><br />Note: I have small wrists and this fits perfect! Larger wrists might want to reconsider., just what I needed to attach my new band, I have nothing but accolades for this watch. Subtle and attractive., The numbers do not glow in the dark., This band is a good quality, but is not extra long as advertised. It is the same length as the standard bands., Amazing quality and so light.  Forget I have it on at times.  All my friends want to know about it.  Great buy !!, Beautiful bracelet , fast shipping . Will def order again, I gave this product max stars because of its WOW factor. It's fun to watch when you push the TIME button and different color lights start flashing to give you the time most people can't figure out in the beginning. I liked the watch so much I bought two additional spares. Price was so low replacing the battery will probably be more costly. By the way, the watch works great., Very attractive and elegant, Perfect!! Area trend make feel really important 5 stars! Quick delivery, Fits perfectly and exactly as expected the shipping took a little while but it worth waiting so unique and vintage looking watch<br />Definitely recommend it ., Dears,<br />How it is possible to repair when that time i use the second &#34; hand&#34; not working properly , everytime not moving but the time is working .<br />Please help what is possible solution .<br /><br />Thanks & best Regards<br />Rommel, Beautiful watch.  Excellent graduation gift., Thin face ..hard strap leather.. Deficult to read, I had to return this, poor quality., Thank, bought it as a present for my wife - people just go &#34;Wow&#34; !!, All I can say is, its worth the money and a very nice watch, Great quality Invicta watch that is an awesome edition to my collection of watches. I love the big magnifying face of it which makes it easy to read the time, day of week, and date at a quick glance. The versatility of the leather watch straps is also a plus to better coordinate with various wardrobe styles. I am very doubtful that I will ever use the blue watch band that is just my personal preference. I have no regrets purchasing this fine time piece., Looks beautiful keeps steady timer so far, My boyfriend loved this gift for his birthday and it came in a Armani Exchange box with a little book for instructions and just more proof that it is the real thing. The only thing I had a problem with was that when I first opened it to check there was scratches on the plastic cover holding the watch and I guessed it was from the watch, didn't really see any damages to the watch so I decided to it was okay. It was a bit big for my bf so we had to resize the link so if you're unsure of the size you should buy something small like that minuscule screwdriver that is used to fix glasses to fit inside the holes of the links., It's an okay watch for fashion, Excellent Wacth!!!, Excellent wacth!!!, I read a lot of reviews for this and thought it would be a breeze to use. I read that some people suggested to inflate the ball and it was a cinch to get the watch back off. I tried it both as it came and inflated and I cannot get the back off of my husbands watch. He has a Tommy Bahama watch that he researched for how to get the back off and it seemed easy enough. However, we have not been able to get the back of his watch off. It's a fun ball for my toddler to run after now., Trying to find out where origin of brand is from. I like the watch verymuch., Beautiful watch. Couldn't be happier with my purchase., The best piece of item ever bought on amazon. This watch is so beautiful and look so gorgeous, if there was a 10 star I would give it 11star, An excellent quality watch coupled with a competitive price. It is a no brainer if you are in the market!, unique and quality product, Not exactly what I wanted but it'll do., Nice watch got several compliments, This is a great toy. The ABC readings are not super accurate but they are certanly fun.<br /><br />When on a hike, I'd suggest to re-calibrate the altimeter (very easy to do) at the trailhead and then every time you see an altitude marker. That way you can actually have pretty good measurements.<br /><br />In regards to temperature do not expect to have good readings from your wrist. Take the watch off and wait for a few minutes.<br /><br />I like that the face turns off at night to save power and I love that it receives the radio signal every night to keep up with the atomic timekeeping.<br /><br />In short, this is not a professional tool and by any means gives you precise measurements. If you plan to climb Mt. Annapurna and rely on its readings then you should look somewhere else. But it's super fun and it surely satisfies all your Junior Woodchucks needs., Number 4 is wrong., This watch is WONDERFUL and holds upwell. I recommend it for anyone who wants their children to become confident in being able to tell time. In our house it was becoming a struggle to get our 9 year old to tell time so we got her this and all of the sudden she can look at a clock and figure it out! This watch played a huge part in that and gave her confidence., Great watch so far, I have been wearing Timex Expedition watches for 15 years. Always been a good watch, not so big watch still working fine now, I arrived item thank you, After reading the book does more than what I needed hahahaha!, Seems useful but the pins are bent., The wrist band broke right when my son put it on. We had to return it which was super easy., 7 year old grandson really feels cool with this watch.  it has survived many a pool swim and dive at 3 feet.<br />fits his wrist and like all kids figured out the modes pretty quickly.<br />I really like this Timex watch and more importantly he does too, Watch is large but reasonably light.  It is well worth the size.  Display is bright and easy to read.  Setting it to my time zone was easy.  The only real negative is the tiny sized but thick instruction manual evidently designed for very small readers.  A larger manual with fewer pages would be much easier to hold and read.  I bought this watch to replace the previous model, which broke its strap after five years.  The old watch itself still operates well.  It has been a real treat not to have to replace dry cells at any time; the solar charger operates just fine., It took a while tell it gets here but Nice looking cute watch and thank God I have small arm rest cause it's soo small if you have a bit wide pons arm rest don't purchase it ., Adjustment screw heads missing the groove to turn them out., Thank you !, I wanted a low-profile watch for travel where pulling a phone out to check the time is inconvenient.  I have a small wrist so needed a small watch that was still readable.  Not so easy to find.  This one is perfect.  It is small but very readable - even the date.  It has two time zones - great for travelers.  And it has a light which actually lights the numerals so you can read them. Things to know:  The watch doesn't lie flat which means that the true width of the watch is all the silver that you see - that stretches completely across my wrist.  The band is a little stiff and a little longer than I would like but it is okay.  Most importantly, the directions have an error.  The buttons are not labeled correctly in the graphic.  They are actually ABCD, working counter clockwise.  I discovered this when I went online to print out a bigger version and saw that they had been re-marked. It is easy to operate once you are using the right buttons!, Oh My God!! Quality is unbelievable, comes with a very nice box. Perfect for gift. It looks like a $500 watch!!!, Watch is very good looking. Easy to set. Hands are very easy to see. Lightweight and water resistant. The strap is plenty<br />long even for one like me with pretty thick wrists. The hands are the only thing illuminated at night. Not super bright, but<br />can be read. Would absolutely recommend., OKAY, The band was a little tight,but I think it will stretch in time,& I have a small wrist, Received my beautiful watch a few hours a go!!!! Love it already!!!<br />It defiantly  is a beautiful watch but at first look I was doubtful if it was a legit guess watch!!!!<br />But after checking everything it looks good to me!!!<br />Though as mentioned in the description it didn't come in a GUESS GIFT BOX it rather came in a GUESS ZIP LOCK pouch!!!!!<br />Also the key was pushed in which means the watch was already working doubt for how long it's been working and for how long the battery will survive ¿¿<br />Also there was no protection seal or the transparent wrap on the glass or the strap at all.... But neither did I see any scratches or any other usage or damage signs!!!!<br />So far so good just been a few hours!!! Will surely update with time!!!!<br />Also I have attached the pics... The tag says 115$ but I got mine for about 80$!!<br />Thanx., Elegant, receive lots of compliments., I have no idea why i am the first review to show up here. Something seems super sketchy! These watches &#34;look&#34; fine, but are terrible quality!, I was in love with the watch from the very start. It had a great feel and weight on my wrist and was a very good looking watch. The dial turned easily and I used it daily for timekeeping at work and home. It says that the watch is waterproof down to 200M, which is pretty incredible for any watch, but my experience has not shown this capability. After the first time I went swimming with the watch on, no deeper than a few meters at most, the watch took in water and has had droplets on the inside of the glass ever since that does not go away. I have tried to file a complaint via amazon but with no luck. Also, the dial does not turn at all anymore., I already use it to adjust one of my new watch. It works! The price is cheap for what it can do rather than paying more to just adjust your bracelet,, Love it; looks good, keeps accurate time,I  use the chronometer to time my track team runners, fits my large wrist, people think its a $200.00 watch!!!, I used this a few times for taking timed tests and it served me well.<br />I like my watches face downward on my wrist and even after mashing the clock face on a desk, it was still intact with few very minor scratches.<br /><br />I don't use watches too often but after a month or two I found the watch and it wasn't telling the correct time anymore.<br />you need to wind it up every now and then., Just what I wanted in a watch., love this watch - simple, and stylish, The leather band is very soft and flexible., I am wearing it as I type this review on my Citizen Ecozilla. The rubber strap was too stif, I had to stop wearing the watch after a day or so. With this nato strap I can go week or untill I get bored., This watch is incredible. Looks and works flawlessly. Highly recommended. It's a bit priceybut iit's worth it. Great build and sturdy. Solar and radio timekeeping work very well. It's a bit heavy but very comfortable to wear. I wear<br />this watch all day with no discomfort. There are other G-Shock s at a lower price that are also excellent but you do get what you pay for. This watch is premium and truly the master of<br />G-Shocks. I own three other G-Shock watches but this is my favorite go to watch., For a watch with bad threads on the caseback it works, Color fades away turns brown after one week waist if my money never agian purchase any item like this !!!!!!!, Crystal stones were missing out of bracelet, love this watch, very comfortable and attractive--get lots of compliments., Good watch for the price, a lot of function that I will probably never use. The display is pretty good and I can see it in sun light; at night I have to push a button to light it up. I wish this kept the watch lit longer but its OK. I would buy again., I like it., Fantastic product! No battery needed just twist and go. Looks a lot better in person!, So far I give it 5 stars. I have only had it a few weeks. Will see what happens after being outside and swimming., Cool, THe watch stops working after few hours. The hands stop working if left ideal for some time. I don't know if there is some problem with the watch or if it batteries need changing. Please provide some solution as it doesn't look good and feasible to reset the time all the time when this happens to be a new watch. Just dissatisfied with this product., Extremely good looking watch.  Haven't taken it off since it arrived.  Many compliments from friends., Nice watch, good price. But there was one missing stone on the face watch, I had the same problem with the other watch I ordered last time. Missing stone on the face. I returned it and bought this watch and here we go again I have had the exactly same problem. I think Amazon should take a closer look on how they should handle these delicate things and make sure there is not any defects on them prior shipping out to customers. It is my second time I have to ship it back to get another one. Disappointed...!!!, It's beautiful, just as the picture<br />I will definitely order more<br />Five stars all the way<br />Thanks Amazon, This device is awesome.  My wife purchased a nice watch and it was too big.  This device was easy to use and does a great job!, This is a stunning watch. It's so unusual and quite beautiful.  I bought it for a gift and the person loved it but it was too heavy to actually wear for a woman. Now for a guy it might be better fitting but not for a woman. However the watch is FABULOUS!!, OKAY, This is a really nice inexpensive and attractive watch. It does just about everything you could want a watch to do. Complete date, month, day, year, day of the week. Stop watch. Lighted dial on demand. Water resistant.  These plastic watches are hearty which I like, especially for teens, or younger kids. The face of the dial is flush with the watch body so the crystal should last. Overall, I think this is a great watch, well-priced watch for an active busy woman into sports, and outdoor activities. It is made well and should hold up under a lot of activity., This watch has different prices!!, Pretty watch...but stopped working after a few weeks, not sure yet they stopped runing hopeing its just the battery, Excellent and beautiful, Perfect!, everything is perfect, I like the watch itself but not the wrist strap, it just isn't very appealing., Very cheap and fragile., It was a mistake in my address. Fianlly I got the beautiful watch. The best seller with the best product! Thank you very much! I will recommend to my friends!, Had a few problems with communication at first, but his is a great company and they made things right. Thank you I will buy this with any products in the future. Money well spent., I like the watch a hole lot thanks Amazon, I had two (returned one for replacement and then had to return the replacement) of these that I ended up having to return because they both quit within a week and a half of having. They would just stop counting steps completely and by the end of the day would say I basically hadn't moved. I had a lot of hope for this helping me out, but sadly they ended up failing me., My girlfriend got me this watch as a gift and it was listed at $74 when she got it in April of 2015. The watch looks great and the band is comfortable meaning it doesn't rip your arm hair out by the roots or anything and it is easy enough to remove and add links, it's actually slightly nicer than most bands I've had. The watch face is also fairly easy to read making this watch more than just a bunch of gears to stare at. Now onto the bad parts. The watch runs slightly fast if you live a semi active life, meaning you excercise weekly or ride your bike to work etc.. but this is a very minor problem and the time only needs set about once every two weeks if you want it to stay less than a few minutes off. The spring, when fully wound, will last around 36 to 48 hours from what I have been able to tell.<br />Now I will tell of my customer service experience. After about 2 to 3 months I noticed my hour hand was about 20 min off for example, when it was 11:40, the hour hand would be directly over the 12 so it would make it look like it was 12:40. I sent it in. The process seemed standard, meaning you fill out a form and pay for return shipping which is $15. Then you write down an address if you happen to catch it before you press submit. Shipping both ways costed more than $30 which is unacceptable when I could take it to a watch repair shop, if there was one in my town, for less that. Additionally, it has taken them weeks to fix what seems like a simple problem. I have since bought a second watch (Casio Solar Powered) to use in the meantime because of how incredibly long they are taking. The company didn't seem to care about the customer from what I gathered. The bottom line is that this watch will probably break eventually and when it does, you will be faced with same decision I was faced with which is to pay a lot of money or wear a broken watch and no customer should be forced to make this decision simply because of the cost of claiming the warranty. I would not recommend this to a friend and I will certainly not be getting another watch from this company ever again. If someone gifted me another Kenneth Cole watch I would have them return it immediately. I hope this review helps in your purchasing decision., Very  Cheap material. The wrist band was made from really thin plastic, My kid broke in in the second day. Don't recommend this. Timex is much better quality, Bought this last week. Beautiful clock, but makes a slight ticking noise. So does their [[ASIN:B004XK1L7Y Braun BNC002BKBK Classic Analog Quartz Alarm Clock]] that we tried the week before. The Braun digital clock is quiet, so are using that one [[ASIN:B006J0WT4K Braun BNC008BK LCD Quartz Alarm Clock]] - but be aware, the digital clock is very small., I have had this g shock for about 3 months and I really like it because of the cool color and the analog and digital clock but there are a couple things that I would definitely change. The backlight does not illuminate the numbers up nearly enough. I was running at night and I couldn't see the time. Also, when the minute hand is around 40 it blocks the digital clock which can get annoying. So its a nice looking watch but there is room for improvement., It's a very nice looking watch, but it is hard to see if light shines on it wrong.  Should have a solid white back ground to be an easy reader., Nice Product, good looking.  The only drawback:  If you have a very small wrist it only allows the removal of the double link and two links from each side, so it will tend to fit very loosely, SO fresh and clean, Usually runs a few minutes behind at the end of the week. If you don't wear it for a day you'll have to reset it. Has lasted at least a year now with wear and tear. Goes everywhere with me except the shower. But it is water proof., Very uncomfortable to wear. The band is very stiff., A wonderful watch, let see how it performance, The key to this watch is the band and the clasp (one hand operation).  Otherwise it's a typical digital watch and the price is right., Didn't make it through the day, definitely not worth the very long wait.., bad, I bought the watch July 22 since it's arrival I have really enjoyed wearing it. The watch looks very well made but all of a sudden there has been some moisture under the crystal that seems to not want to go away after a week. I have not been in the water or any area that I would have come in contact. Not sure what will be done about it since I haven't been able to talk to any one yet about replacing or repairing it, It's hard to get customer service on the phone., Excellent!!!, I really like it, cute., I like the overall size of the watch but found that it was too thick and heavy for me. I have a small wrist so it didn't look right. Overall I like the look of the watch but didn't love it due to the thickness and weight., I like the blue shades, It was what I expected !, It broke after only 3 months., Bands broke off this after a month., Just got the watch but first impression is that it seems quality built. Very stylish and the silicone band feels nice., A real Good looking Im Sure machine will last forever, I was looking for a nice looking watch that was solar and also water proof. This one fit the bill perfectly.  I did a lot of research and this was the best one.  It is very nice looking, a bit heavier than my old watch but very striking.  I wanted a solar watch as my very expensive old watch was ruined when the back was damaged when I had the battery replaced.  Living in Hawaii you never know when you are going to get caught out in a rain storm so I needed my watch to be water proof also.  The catch on the band is much harder to accidentally pop open than the older Seiko watch that I had given to my daughter (it is still running after 20 years).  I would recommend this watch to anyone., Cheap, accurate, dependable watch.  The band finally gave out after 5 years and it was cheaper to buy a new one than get a new band., you get  what you pay for.<br />quality poor<br />stop watch function does not work, Beautiful watch, but look to big on the hand (a matter of taste ofcourse) and to expensive, It does the job. I couldn't get the supplied pins to fit my watch... they seemed too long. But the old pins fit, so it worked out., I needed a replacement Seiko dive strap as the original was beginning to show signs of cracking and fatigue. This Seiko strap is just like the original and fits the watch lugs perfectly. I did change out the strap buckle and replaced it with the original (as mentioned by other reviewers) as I like my original satin finished buckle rather than polished. I now have a spare just in case. The watch strap was also supplied with a new set of Seiko 22 mm X 2.5 mm spring bars, a nice added touch., I love the look of this watch but it does not work well...runs about 15-20 minutes slow. Bummer, Item was delivered July 18, 2015 & now the time is always delayed. It works on and off, The 4 on the face of this watch fell off and is floating around inside. Poor quality., My third one in 15 year.  I like the size of the numbers and it really has more functions than I use.  Just the right size as well, It's not even worth the money they charge has to be reset every other day or so and I think the cheap metal in the band might be giving me a rash?, i like it., Size doesn't mean performance. Although the details saying &#34;Not water resistant,&#34; I washed dishes and flooded the watch an hour after putting it on.  I didn't read the specific detail, I was looking for the big dial. No watch is worth babysitting each time I'm near water., Beautiful watch.  My husband loved it, easy to read, water proof. can wear all day and even into the pool., This is a nice little strap for the price. I was given a promotional discount to try this out, but I'd have been fine paying full price for it. I don't feel there's anything that sets it apart really, but if the price is right then I'd definitely recommend picking one up!, It is everything I expected.., It's a cool watch, stop working within a few months of use, it wont charge and made phone calls by itself, screen locks and im unable to use it ., Picture of watch is a little misleading.  Band is not completely brushed steel (middle links are polished), which is not what I expected.  Other than that, it's a good-looking piece, for the price., It's a great looking watch, but I had to return it, as the band was too large, and no way that I could see to make it smaller.<br />There is also no way to contact the seller to find out if the band could be made smaller.<br />ALSO, where the day of the week shows, it appears to be in SPANISH, not English. Why wasn't that in the description?, This strap also fits 5600J. Very hard to put on. I used a eye glass screwdriver to put new strap on. I cut the old strap off with a knife. It also helped to have a second person help. Would have gave 5 star but no new pins came with the strap., The watch arrived on time. It looks nice.i hope it'll  work well and right., was fine while it lasted, had high hopes for this watch and am usually pretty good on what I buy. Granted it wasn't expensive but the watchband fell off the watch within two months. Don't buy, find better quality for a bit more expensive., My son wears this watch occasionally he hasn't complained yet about the quality.  It must be good!  I Used this back to replace a metal one he needed links for., This thing has 3-4 settings. I Can't recall. But it's 10 minutes on and 20 minutes off. 1 hour on and 2 hours off. What kind of winder is this? I need it to be wound 24/7. That's how the watch gets wound. I don't have a cheap watch by all means. It's a Tissot. But I put it in this thing and it dies. Whoever designed it should have their heads examined. I am glad Amazon took it back., Power cord &#34;conked&#34; out after 1 month. Been unable to use until we buy another power cord., Present for young girl..she us happy with it, Really bad product! It arrived late - very late - directly from China, and it wasn't keeping time after 3 days., This strap isn't much longer than average/normal straps I have used.  Needs to be 1 1/2 to 2 inches longer.  The big guy has NO WHERE TO GO to purchase good watch straps.  There has got to be a market out there.  Otherwise quality is ok., This item is an easy install and the watch is so much easier and faster to put on. Good quality and here in 2 days.. Gotta love &#34;Prime&#34;.. Here is a little video on how to install and use the Clasp in the title line.. HTTPS://YouTu.be/m6-8aJnyzrc, Perfect !!, Is it worth $60?  Probably/maybe.  Should it be confused with anything other than a lightweight, semi-inferior watch?  No.  Suitable for my 14 year-old son?  Absolutely.  The band is low quality (links, pins, etc) - that typically says it all for me.  Huge durability questions., All three children I bought these for were really impressed with them, after two weeks the setting crown cracked off in regular circumstances.<br />the watch is fairly comfortable and the watch face is nice.<br />the dials are a little confusing but it isn't so important anyway., The quality was worth the price however the face was not perfect and had headed marks around a dial., This set is really cute and fashionable.  I bought it as a birthday present and I think the young lady (turning 16) who will receive it will be very pleased., Super cool...appears heavy...but light on the hand....great design., I really wanted this watch but I'm broke. So I went and got a very painful surgery to get my kidney removed, cause I couldn't afford the numbing stuff. I then sold it and got bank. I then ordered this watch as quick as I could. But before I could get it, someone stole it. Just my luck. So that is why I'm giving this 4 stars, but I imagine that this watch is great, and all I got to show for it is a scar where my kidney used to be., Awesome watch. Unlike so many other watches today, the face size is normal, not HUGE. I'd say medium so it's proportional on an average man's wrist. It's also light. My favorite feature is the face. Bright orange with bright white fat hands make it super easy to read. And the night light feature lights up the entire face, not just a tiny digital display, which is quite the norm on other inexpensive watches. Ses to be high quality so I hope it lasts until at least the battery dies. Awesome watch, great price!, I love it! I wear it mostly everyday to work. The only thing wrong with it is that the knob on the side turned black that is a bit disappointing., Good watch for everyday use, it works well and doesn't look cheap., It came in just a couple days, easy to set, and looks good.  Accuracy perfect so far (little over a week) and self winding works super , you can even see self wind thru back glass window.  I just gotta figure out how to remove a link from the bracelet , the pins are screwed in but hard to loosen., It was a Birthday gift for my wife. She loves the watch. Clean, clear and classy looking., Had to change battery when I received it. Functions erratically but I still like the look., Good so far. Setting the date is a little wonky, but that could just be operator error., OKAY, Beautiful watch! I love it! I'm not an expert on watches but this one looks pretty damn good; sophisticated and expensive. I have a tiny wrist it looks amazing after I adjusted the band., Nice looks, weight & feel!  Many comments from admirers asking what brand is it.  Even though my Citizen's Eco cost three times as much & a little more technology, it definitely is just as admirable.  A nice business/casual watch & if it holds up, it's 5 stars!, Works well.  I like it for my small wrist., It's still new so I'm getting used to it.  If it lives up to other Timex Watches I've owned it will be fine., much nicer than I expected!, Bigger frame glasses dont sit well on the little shelfs., Great watch, the face is fantastic, really clear and easy to read, the little dials not so much, The watch is awesome. It keeps great time and it looks nice. I can have my Buckeye's watch and it goes with just about anything I wear. Highly recommend purchasing this., Quality of watch exceeds price paid. Excellent purchase., Awesome watch!, I love this watch! The retail price according to the website is $115, which I think is a bit steep, but this item is definitely made with high quality materials. I think the red, white, and blue pattern is very patriotic but also eye-appealing. I love the ebony wood grain surface. I purposely got this for my boyfriend, who knows a lot about different woods, and he had said ebony wood is not really imported much into the US anymore and is very high quality, so I decided to get this for him as a surprise. The watch itself works very well, and the band is a little more stiff than I would have liked but I imagine it will loosen up after a bit of use. Everything about this watch screams quality and the design is so unique. People are bound to comment on it once I give this to him for him to wear. Overall, I love this watch, and I really think it's made with excellent quality and will last a while. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinion., The face of this watch is rather large. I returned it and choose one with a smaller face., Didn't like it at all. Very cheap made stones was glued uneven and upside-down. Return it. It was completely my fault tho. ...MK for 20$ you wish, go horns, Yes I like this watch, I gave it to my wife as a gift because she want it, It's lit, This looks to be a very well made and attractive watch, but both watches I received have had defective movements. The first watch, I noticed that watch would loose 5 mins for every 30 minutes. So, I requested a replacement. The replacement watch did work out of that box so I took it to a jeweler who could test the battery and the battery was fine. This means it was another defective movement. At this point, I requested a refund. Very disappointing., I work for an utility company and my job consist in being outdoors a lot. This watch is perfect for me. Very comfortable and not cheaply made., Awesome, like I wished for., My girlfriend loved it she was so happy and a lot lower price then many stores, Elegant, Love the look. Pretty lightweight. As the other reviews state, it is hard to see the digital parts at night., This is my fourth Timex Ironman watch.  That might sound bad, but when you consider that I purchased my first as a Peace Corps volunteer almost 20 years ago, that's pretty awesome!  I love the style, that they are rugged a take a beating (from trekking from the bottom of South America all the way through Central America and Mexico, numerous scuba trips, endless beach outings, two children and everything in between!), and that the newer versions come in nicer color and a slimmer design than previously.  Easy to program and use all of the features from the timer (so I don't burn the meatloaf), to the chronograph (for my son's lap times), to the multiple alarms. My favorite feature has always been the waterproof design...as a avid beach bum, snorkeler and previous scuba diver, these watches take a beating and last for years.<br /><br />I finally migrated from my basic black to this pretty gray and teal face...it's a nice change. I prefer the plastic bands over the nylon...too much time in the water can make the nylon bands smell terrible.  This is a slightly larger watch for woman....not the super slim design sometimes seen with woman's Timex, but not as large as a man's version.  I am very happy with this purchase!, The watch just broke on its on! I purchased this watch April 2015 and today the number 1 letter came out of the watch and it dangling. This watch is only used on special occasion so it hasn't even bee used more than 3 times. I like an exchange or a refund., Had this watch for 2 weeks. already has a chip on the crystal and condensation is under it. I work a relatively low-impact job, so this is severely upsetting.  Had it replaced once already. After not even 3 weeks of -moderate- work, another chip in another spot. New crystal, chipped again. Cheap crystal, my assumption. Not even bothering sending back. Do not recommend., The strap is very good looking but once I tried it on one part of the strap broke already..., Dope watch very durable!, The watch looks very good and it feels solid but I am disappointed with the calibration.  After one month, the dial for the day of the week was significantly off.  The minute dial also had a problem. It was too late to return to Amazon,so I had to send it in to Casio and they temporarily fixed it.  Casio did respond quickly I must say. Now after a year, it has happened again and it's out of warranty.  It is also complicated to set the time.  Read the instructions carefully. I also have a G-shock with atomic time keeping and the atomic part stopped working a year after I bought it. I think I will just sell the watch and buy another brand.  I am not happy with Casio., Amazing. Big, heavy, elegant. I love it., Looks good (not cheap) and holds up well. Wear it almost every day and to the hospital. Like it very much., This watch is everything I needed it to be and more. I am very happy with my choice.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I had to resize the bracelet myself or have it done because it was shipped too big. I just was frustrated a bit because I couldn't wear it right out of the box., You just know when you see these style of kits, you are not getting the best set of tools ever made.  I had to add links to a citizen watch, and I used this tool set to do it.  I'm not sure I did the right thing with the right tools, but I got the job done.  Inserting the link pins back in was very difficult to do with a tapered watch band.  At once point, I had to have my wife hold the band on it's side in the block so I could drive the pin back in.  I couldn't have done the job with out this kit though, so it's worth the money., This watch is way see than I thought it would be, if your a guy like me, trust me you should save your money and buy something else, it's like a ladies watch. Other than that though it's pretty nice, I would be satisfied with this watch if it was bigger., I need a watch like a hole in the head.  But, while shopping at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, this store had a case of dw watches<br />and I was struck as to how beautiful they were, so I bought one, not realizing that they were on sale on Amazon for half the price that I paid. The staff were wearing dw watches which looked great on them.  Anyway, I love the watch and am glad that I bought it.<br /><br />Robert States, COOL, a really sharp looking watch that seems to keep time well. I've only had the watch a couple of days so it remains to be seen how well the watch will hold up, but over all I'm very satisfied with my purchase. the leather seems to be of high quality and is very comfortable on my wrist. The watch is also much lighter than i thought it would be. the one thing taking away from the watch is that i found the instructions could have been more clear, it seems they tried to keep their instructions short and simple but i believe a little more information would have made setting my watch up just a little easier. i purchased my watch on a lightening deal, so i didn't pay full price., Terrible watch...moisture got in it first time in the water., COOL, Crystal fell out., COOL, Fits great!  The product seems to be good quality.  I like the color.  It is easy to understand.  I received this at a discount for an honest review., Battery  was dead upon receiving  thia product. NOT a deal for me, gorgeous watch. get many compliments. just the right size. wish it was automatic., Cheap and doesn't look like it. Got compliments on it. albeit from kids but hey it still counts., Substandard.  Not the same as the picture., Perfect  the only winder I would trust my watches too..., It's not the easiest watch to fix the time or date., I really love this watch ;) is beautiful very tiny perfect for a elegant women, This is a beautiful, well made watch., The rate is for how it looks, its not been used yet because it will be a gift for christmas, LOVE IT! Just came yesterday! I ordered it for my husbands anniversary present! It is a beautiful watch, big too! Comes in a nice box also!, I get compliments about this watch whenever I wear it; I also get comments about its size. While it can be a bit heavy at first, the feeling goes away quickly (even for a somewhat smaller guy like myself) and is a joy to look at and wear. If you can handle the size and weight, it's a beauty that's sure to catch people's attention., COOL, This looked nice but fell apart within a month. It was a gift that was picked out by the receiver., Good price, easy to read. Band seemed a little stiff at first, but got flexible after a few times wearing it., watch band too small, This watch is perfect for what I bought it for. I needed a watch with a second hand for nursing school. I like this watch - it's cute, white (so it matches no matter what color I wear and any dirt on it can be easily seen), it's a plastic material (to be easily cleaned), good quality, water-resistant, great price (I paid $18.75), durable (I have worn it 3x/week for about 6 months) and doesn't look cheap. I have not experienced any yellowing of the band or any cons that I can think of. The face of the watch is on the smaller side - but I would rather this versus too large of a face that makes it look gaudy. I haven't experienced any problems with comfortability or fit. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and wouldn't hesitate to buy again., Very solid made watch., LOVE! It's such a pretty and classy watch.  I took it to a Michael Kors store to get a sized for free.  Thank you to the people that posted pictures of this watch. This is why I ultimately decided to purchase it., This watch is beautiful ...elegant and delicate ...and I'm so glad found it at such amazing price at Amazon ...also very fast delivery ..:) highly recommended A+++, This is a very fancy watch for your significant other, or even someone close to you. The price of the watch is crazy high, but MyHabit has it for a great deal for you. Its all leather, thick top clear piece on  top. Handles rain, and showering just fine. Fits about any wrist, except any huge wrists like my husbands. The band is leather, and fits comfortably on your wrist day and night. The front clock has some really neat features. Then the back has a cool looking spinning mechanism on it. Takes a small watch battery but they last forever anyways. This watch does cost a lot, but totally worth it to anyone who loves wearing watches, especially ones that are in detail. This is a Heritor brand company, which is a great brand and very popular., It has military time, the date of the month, & color coded. The only problem is that it is very small, like a children's watch. But I have a skinny wrist so it's fine but still somewhat hard to see., Awesome purchase, This is my new favorite watch--beautiful (I keep staring at it throughout the day), lightweight, very legible and accurate.  I have 10 other watches that I no longer wear., I would love to have another one of these watches. It is sleek and attractive. I would often get compliments on it. At the time I got it on sale for $70. Unfortunately it stopped working after about 2 years. I thought it was the battery and took it to get replaced and was told that it had a mechanical issue. I took it to a watch maker and was told it would cost over $100 to fix. I do love this watch, no denying that, but I wish that it was just a little more durable., Worked well., The Only Ironman watch to have.  The only one with a durable stainless bracelet, where the link pins can't rip through the rubber spacers like the other Timex ironman model with the metal bracelet setup.  It has the excellent hi-vis Indiglow night display when sitting in the duck blind or deer stand.  I have had other models of the Ironman watch, and they all have warts.  Dead grass in the Velcro, having to fumble with a belt like buckle, metal bracelet watch band that rip apart on one snag of the watch on a anything because every other link on the band is rubber..  This model is the best, and also out of production by timex.  It is the only true Ironman watch they have made., I have had this little guy for 2 years and it's still going strong! I never take it off. It goes in the shower on a daily basis, was in a swimming pool for two lifeguard seasons, has withstood hiking, rockclimbing, basketball, travel, concerts etc...and switching timezones has never been easier (or more fun).<br />I superglued the pins in place after one broke within the first two months...do that and this thing will definitely outlive the money you spend on it! Looks great too!, This is an excellent watch, and arrived on time., EVERYONE THINKS IT IS THE ROLEX THAT I HAD TO SELL!!!, Black case was &#34;shiney black&#34; not matte...did not look good., Very pretty, love the style of this watch. is lightweight, and works fine to do sport., Perfect!!!, AWESOME, Purchased for my son's bd less than 8 weeks ago and the minute hand is already broken.  Of course it is not eligible for return, so we have to send a check and the watch to the manufacture.  He loves the watch too, but I cannot say I will buy this product again., I'll have to admit I'm a tad disappointed but the whole &#34;Platinum Ice&#34; thing compensates for most of that.<br />You see I was on Shnoop and bought an Accutron that usually lists at $700.00 for $120 and it only loses 2 seconds in 6 months.  Then I bought another Shnoopie for $100 that usually lists for $650 and it only gains 3 seconds in 6 months.<br />I was hoping at this price it would be accurate to a couple of nanoseconds a decade but it's less accurate than either of the Accutron Shnoopies.<br />Oh well, live and learn I guess, while I wouldn't say the blue is really &#34;blue&#34; at least the ceramic really is ceramic., Stylish, with pretty good fit. I would actually prefer that it have one more link, but that's a minor concern. I like how well it goes with my watch, and it's much better than the OEM band that came with the watch., typical timex. Good value for your money, Tested down to 27ft. I work in an aquarium so it is constantly exposed to salt and harsh conditions. It has weathered several drops and bad bangs on doors and countertops without damaging the watch. I LOVE the indiglo function for dimly lit conditions inside the building and in the water., If you have a thin wrist it will fit, but it is very tight on an average size wrist. Also the crown is very small and difficult to turn with adult fingers. The box it comes in is pretty crummy as well. They have stopped using watch boxes and it came on a plastic spindle with no box at all. It does keep accurate time and is very light to wear, just hope it lasts for a while., Amazing timepiece its very beautiful in person and I never regretted buying this lovely timepiece. The only downside is that its not solar drive buh all in all its still a very nice watch., VERY BEAUTIFUL!! MY GIRLFRIEND  HAPPY!, Really love how amazing this watch looks. Would defintley recommend it., Pretty, This watch is only design. That it.<br />It  isn't working  good some function a few months later.  Even  NO warranty<br /><br />I asked them  warranty  .<br />how can i contact the manufacturer (Haurex)?<br /><br />They said. ......  INTERNET.<br /><br />Only the word answer.<br /><br />Bad service.  Bad attitude.  Bad warranty., This watch is very pretty but it's very hard to work and understand., Thank You, This pocket watch is very nice and stylish.  It was received quickly and in good condition - well packaged.  Very happy with this purchase., It looks better in pictures. Quality is poor. You may use it just for looking the time, don't expect anything more. I thought it was big but turned out it wa-s a small watch., This is a very nice watch, especially for the price.  It is nicely packaged and the automatic winder is a very good idea.  However, I found that the dial was difficult for me to read.  In my opinion, Swiss Legend needs to design in more contrast between the hands, dial face, and numerals.  I buy larger watches mainly because they are easier to read and I find this lack of clearness a big drawback for me.  For others with better eyesight than mine this may not be such an important matter.  I am returning this watch but I would not hesitate to recommend it to those who can see a little better than I do., Looks like just what it cost.  But it is a fun one to have and the nostalgia that you get from something that does not contain electronics makes it great., I bought seven of these for every day of the week. Worst decision of my life!!!! The front is horrendous. All of the strippers at the clubs i own in Miami said it looks like an old mans watch from target. I decided to donate it to charity because they would need it more than me. also the batteries came dead., Awesome piece of workmanship, First of all I want to say this is a beautiful watch.  It gets noticed and I want to love it.  The band's reptilian &#34;scales&#34; look great.  It's heavy, but gorgeous.<br /><br />I have a couple of issues with this watch, one consequentia,l the other unignorable.<br /><br />I have an issue with the company's instruction manual which could have caused me to return the watch. The watch's operation is somewhat complicated in that you have to unscrew all buttons and crown to get them to work, yet the generic instructions don't mention this.  I was able to resolve this issue by watching a Youtube video reviewing the watch, but if this video wasn't available, I might have never figured out how it operates.<br /><br />I have another, this time deal-breaking issue with this watch.  It is supposed to be watertight down to 1000 meters.  I took it swimming in my 5' (1.7m) pool for less than 10 minutes and it has now developed a foggy crystal.  I had to return it for this reason.  Sigh...<br /><br />Like I said, I wanted to love it.<br /><br />Though I could try another one of this model, my confidence in Invicta is low right now.  I purchased another Invicta watch (at $1/3 the price of this one) along with this one, so I will reserve final judgment until I have had that one for awhile., I bought this for an 8 year old boy who loved it.  The watch was easy to set up and is working well., This is the third time I am buying one of these watch rolls.  First I bought the brown (coco) and blue one.  Both were identical quality and looked good.  Then I wanted to order a red one but decided last minute to buy this black version because it looked updated with a covered button.  Now I regret it because I found out that although the interior is similar to the two others, the exterior feels far less quality.  Even to a level that i doubt real leather was used for the outside of the roll.  So the function is still the same, the feeling is far less., This is a neat watch.  I really like the movement, and the &#34;open heart&#34; design.  I don't love the band, but it's still a very interesting watch, and I really like it., Was disappointed seemed too dark in color and felt cheaply made but will see how it holds up, Excellent watch. Feels, looks and function like any more expensive watch., I replaced a Casio F-108WH which died with this watch. It is much smaller and to read. It looks more a ladies watch., This is a beautiful watch. I like the large size many others complained about, however I have a large wrist so it feels good. I returned two other watches prior to this because they felt so tiny. The watches movements are quite, unlike one of the others I looked at. It drove me crazy during the day. This is great watch I plan to wear for years to come., Nice looking watch but the buttons around the crown are nonfunctional, they and the small dials are for looks only, attractive and easy to set and easy to read. I love it, Thnx, Great looking watch. Not so big that it looks cartoonish. Been loudly ticking away for over 2 weeks without losing a minute. One wind lasts more than 2 days. Only complaint would be that the band appears to be too wide.  It doesn't fit smoothly through the buckle and has to be forced through.  Its not a huge issue and definitely doesn't stop me from wearing it., You get what you pay for :), OKAY, I had been looking for a mechanical aviator style watch for some time when I came across this Orient Pilot. I have had this watch for over a year, and it has been incredibly accurate once regulated, running about +/- 2 seconds per day. At 42mm diameter with 22mm lugs, the quality of this watch compares favorably with the Hamilton Khaki at less than half the price. I wear this watch every day, and the case, crystal and black leather band are still flawless. If you are looking for a Military style automatic, then you can't go wrong with this watch., Very satisfied with this watch.The band takes a bit of getting used to but it holds together securely and I've decided to keep it as is for now. Aesthetically the watch is first rate, it is much more impressive in hand than the pictures suggest. The sweep second hand and the tuning fork logo are nicely done. Accuracy is outstanding so far., It's a pretty cool watch for the price.only had a few problems calabrateing it but it helped reading the manual. Takes about half an hour to have everything calibrated., People know me for my big watches, do this is great. Being older , I don't need my reading glasses for these. Thinking of purchasing s different color too., I gave 5 stars for the value and style of this invicta.. it's rated to 200 or 300 meters which is well beyond the capability of any casual diver or even pro for that matter.<br />My only disappointment is it does not seem to be as robust or built tank like, as compared to older models. I have an older quartz movement invicta that you just can't kill..had it over 15 yrs and still going strong.  Time will tell if this holds up as well.<br />But you can't go wrong for the price.  I recomended this watch, Excellent, very cheap looking...cant even figure out how to put on... don't anyone buy this watch..., Subpar, Got it a week ago, because I have a very scratchy stone desk where I work, and all my steel watches got really scratched up. This one still looks like new. I hope it holds up through time. Its a beautiful, comfortable, and practical watch. Update: I've owned this watch for a few months now, I love it even more. The band still looks brand new and is shiny. No scratches what so ever. Beautiful, light, and comfortable. I'm very happy with my purchase., I almost didn't buy this particular watch. I really liked some of the features this watch offered but I wanted the option of a light. I had purchased another Casio watch on Amazon  (Casio Illuminator LA-20WH purple/pink screen) that had a light, date displayed on the main screen, lightweight black band. Pretty much everything I was wanting in a digital watch. The light and date were very important to me. However, when I received it, I became very frustrated with how hard it was to use the buttons. Extremely difficult! By this point, I didn't care about the futures that I just had to have. I had to seriously squeeze the button to get the light to come on. My finger was raw! I decided to keep the watch because it would coast me more money to return it. With all of that said.... (I promise I'm getting to my review on this watch!)  I decided to go for this simple watch KNOWING it wouldn't have a light... Or the date displayed on the main screen.<br /><br />Here is why I love it!!!!  I specifically purchased this watch for the count down timer, the black band, and for it's small size. I read all of the reviews for it prior to buying the first watch and loved how everyone really liked the count down feature. Huge plus for me! I'm a stay at home Mom to four busy kids and I can not tell you how much I've used this feature already! Wow! When you click the top right button a little mark goes under each number. So if I want 15 minutes, click the button 5 times and a little bar blinks right below the number I selected. When I happen to glance down at the watch, I can see that the little bar has moved its way down to the last number- so I know that the timer is gonna go off soon! That's handy to be able to gauge the time. I'm not guessing, &#34;I wonder how long it's been?&#34; Very cool. The screen is the size of a dime. It's small, simple, very clean looking. I wanted a watch that didn't take up my entire wrist, and that was not heavy to wear. I seriously don't feel it at all.The band is so soft and extremely light. I personally do not think it looks cheap as others had mentioned. The pink boarder is like a bubble gum pink, very cute against the black! The numbers are very clear, I have no problems seeing the numbers whatsoever. And I can definitely hear the alarm when it goes off. No problem there- I have a very loud house too. Like other reviewers have said (and what I originally set out for in a watch), this would be the perfect watch if it had a light. I personally haven't mind. I really like all the features and the ease of the watch that the light really doesn't matter anymore. This watch is super simple, super easy to use, and the buttons do not hurt my fingers! One other thing that I absolutely LOVE is that I can push down the bottom right button and the month/date/day will appear. I had read a review that also gave this information and I was so glad they did because having the date was very important to me. Reading that review sold me! I needed this feature. Granted it's not on the main screen but I could live with that! One click, there's the date (8 26 WE)! Awesome! I love this watch you guys! It's a great price, pretty pink, very simple, great for small wrists, sporty look.... I hope this helps you in picking the right watch for you! I also couldn't go wrong with &#34;Free Returns&#34; so I thought why not try it?! Sooo glad I did! ;), OK, COOL, Great storage for any watch I take with me on trips. It's large enough to hold my larger watches without any problems., I received the watch about a week ago, and I've been wearing it everyday. Love the look. Unfortunately it seems the watch would stop or suddenly slows way down every couple of days. A couple of days (day 3 after receiving it) into wearing it, I noticed it was hours behind, but running, when I looked to check the time. Trying to be optimistic I just thought it was because it hadn't been wound enough. I simply adjusted the time and went on with my day. I was checking it through out the day and the next day, and it was running flawlessly. The following day (day 5), I noticed it was again several hours behind! Still trying to be optimistic, I thought I would give it a couple more days thinking it just needed some &#34;breaking-in&#34; as with a lot of mechanical devices. This morning, I noticed it was exactly 2 hours behind! This is the first self-winding automatic watch I've owned. I've read that if the watch movements were magnetized somehow it would affect the accuracy among other things. I hope the problem corrects itself soon. If not, I'll exchange it. I really like the look and the price, so hopefully it works out.  Update: I'm sending it back for a different one. In roughly 5 hours it slowed by almost an entire hour! From reading some of the other review it seems Seiko's quality control and/or the Malaysian movement is not exactly top notch, at least on this line. It's very much hit or miss. I hope the next one I receive doesn't turn out to be another dud.  Update 10/5/15: Receive replacement from Amazon a little over a month ago. This one seems to be a keeper! I've been wearing the replacement almost every day since receiving it, and it's been very accurate. Even when I skipped wearing it for a day it was able to keep accurate time. Again, I love the look and the military green color, but I'm still weary of Seiko's quality control on the movement based on personal experience and other reviews posted here. I realize it's not Japanese movement, and that's one of the reason why it's priced quite low, but I did expect better from a company like Seiko.  Overall if you don't mind maybe having to exchange the watch once (or twice) until you get one that works properly (and you may well get one the first time) it's a good deal for a self-winding automatic., I had one that was looking a bit bad after 5 years of daily use, this was like getting it brand new again for a fraction of what I originally paid $300, Purchased this for my son, a high school junior.  He had a previous version which he used all last year for ROTC to time himself on PT, and through the summer as a lifeguard.  (Being waterproof and having a timer and an alarm are a necessity for him.)  We purchased this version when he lost his old watch because he felt lost without it.<br /><br />Best features:<br />Easy to program<br />Indiglo for nighttime and underwater<br />Simple to set and use timer, alarm and chronograph features<br />Waterproof features<br />Durable and comfortable<br /><br />Great value for the money, Amazing Watch, I returned this watch right after I opened it.  The watch looked more like a lady's watch as the size of the watch is too small for my taste.  I should probably have paid attention to the dimensions and compare to my current watches before purchasing., I love my new invicta watch invicta watches are the best most fashioned watches around an you can't beat the price especially on Amazon. Com....its almost timebto buy another one...lol, Excellent. Holds charge well  and  does a lot, The traditional look and feel of the watch are terrific. So far, so good.  I have an older Stuhrling watch, about,10 years old, that runs better than my Rolex watch., The battery was dead when I received the watch. I had to take it to a jewelry store to have a new one put in., Needed a gold watch to go with my rings. This watch did the trick perfectly. A beautiful and masculine piece that exceeded my expectations! Looks like a million bucks, more beautiful and impressive than the pictures. Very pleased!!!, They are perfect for our seven-year-old and five-year-old children. They have every feature they could possibly want and are more than happy to use them., This Swiss Legend Men's 10020-014-GRYS Highlander Analog Display Swiss Quartz Grey Watch is huge! Fortunately, I am a fairly big guy and it fits me very well.<br /><br />The watch is a left-hand model, made to worn on the right wrist with the controls accessed by the left hand. Fortunately, again, I am left-handed. This has the standard time and date features you would expect but also has a very useful 30-minute count down timer.<br /><br />This is a great looking, if large, watch that would make a great gift for a larger left-handed man.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH, This is an absolutely beautiful watch. It's solid, never needs batteries, and looks so nice on! I love the dark blue face too. It's looks navy blue in outdoor light, and looks very dark, almost black, in artificial indoor light. But even indoors, if there are windows with sunlight coming in, it will still look beautiful deep navy blue. Unique and very pretty contrast to the shiny silver and gold! Also .... I love that it has both the day of the week and date on the face, as well as luminous hands to see in the dark. It is everything that I was looking for! I uploaded some pics so you can get a better idea of the actual color of the face, as well as what it looks like in the dark., Looks better than expected! i might purchase another soon, A great first watch. The band fits beautifully and the numbers on the face are easy for a toddler to read., Overall very nice watch. Lite in weight - not clunky at all. Fits and wears comfortably on wrist, easy to read especially at night with large luminous numbers.  Date is a bit hard to set but once in place works fine.  Quality leather band., Paired with a Seiko SNZG15J1 perfectly., I really like this watch because you can see actual number for all the hours not dots or marks. I wear it most of the time., No bad, good casio replacement., Amazing!, COOL, Initially you did not send installation instructions. I was instructed by you to obtain them from Timex. Unfortunately, these instructions indicate the requirement of a special tool. Consequently, I am in the process of returning the band and I am abandoning use of the Timex., I love Timex Ironman watches.  I have never been disappointed until I got this one.  I got this one 3 days ago and I am returning it due to the face that the face is starting to &#34;peel&#34; off at the bottom.  It looks like a cheap sticker on it.  I will buy another Timex just not this style with the way the face is put together., simple and cheap, This was a gift for my 24 yr. old grandson who scuba dives.  The price was unbelievable....wish we had bought two.  He is very pleased with it.  Recommend!, Very happy with the product., to small but cute., All the features you would expect from an analog-digital G-Shock, but in a smaller package than you would anticipate. Although the specs say 47mm, and measuring at the widest point gets you that number, this wears MUCH smaller than a typical 47mm watch. As is typical of most G-Shocks, much of that width is taken up by the shock-absorbing bezel, and the face is small compared to the diameter of the case. With the metal construction, this model wears even smaller than that, though. The way the bracelet attaches to the lugs allows it fit more snugly around your wrist, and the links are fairly narrow on the back side. The combination of those factors make the watch seem much more moderately sized than the raw numbers would suggest. The bracelet does use solid pins with tiny inserts, so you may want to get this sized by a professional unless you're really comfortable doing it yourself., Beautiful. I have put it my white Skagen watch.  It is well constructed and looks really sharp., Excellent product, Best watch I ever owned, lots compliments, My husband initially loved the look of this watch. Very masculine design, with a huge display, making it very easy to read the time. Functions well, but after playing with it for awhile, it just seems cheaply made. It's also obviously made for a left-hander, which wasn't made clear until it was on his wrist. It's not a big problem, but it would have been nice to know., I love this watch and bracelet combo.It looks cute on and has two different snaps so you can adjust it to fit your wrist. This would make a great gift! I received mine at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would have bought this even without the discount, this is such a cute piece oj jewelry! I highly recommend it!!, very practical.  My partner works with horses and likes that he can wear this at the stables without worry.  Durable and has all the necessary features., Excelent product, This Casio is performant and nice to have if you want to see the time date and to wakeup in the morning by the alarm when you go to work., Love my watch! My wrist is small, but it fits fine!!, Excellent Wacth!!!, After purchasing several Invicta watches I was quite surprised this watch was so thin. Anyone owning an Invicta watch will be disappointed with this model.  I have small wrists and this watch does not stand out.  Beautiful design but did not meet my expectation.  I would love to have a heavier watch., Twenty years ago I bought a Seiko watch very similar to this watch, except it required a battery.  Recently it's been acting up, which is the reason that I bought this SSC141 watch.  The latter is slightly larger.  It looks good and cost less than half of what I paid for my old Seiko.  I have no complaints about the small second hand.  The large stop watch needle is good.  Hope that this watch lasts as long as my  old watch.  As for the  band, I shortened the links by two on each side.  All I used was a large safety pin (point cut off) and a needle nose plier.  Push the pins out (arrow direction) and pull the pins out with the plier.  Reverse the process to put it back.  Knowing how much to remove is the most difficult part.  This process should take about 15 to 20 minutes.  No need any special tools or gadgets. I was going to buy a Citizen eco-drive watch but this Seiko costed less and, I think has a harder crystal.  Hope this helps., oor quality, I like the simplicity of this watch that just tells the time, with a large, very readable face. It keeps very accurate time. It's pretty, too, the leather band is nice and feels like it will hold up to wear and tear. The blue color of the band looks just the same as it did on my monitor, so the color is exactly what I expected and like. The packaging said this watch's movement was made in the Philippines and the strap in India, for those who wish to have countries of origin info., This strap is tight, I love it, I did trim mine a little bit then sealed it by applying heat to the end with a lighter. It absorbs water and stays wet for a while so washing hands can get a little annoying if you just want a full waterproof watch, and it will smell weird after a while if you're active with this strap, so that's the downside. I lost my watch with this strap but I would've imagined I'd have to go to an extreme measure to get rid of the funky built up smell. Don't get it wet I guess. Besides that it looked tight and it was very secure, I was confident of my watch staying in place (part of the reason I replaced my old strap)., Came thru with a chip on the crystal. Never bothered to return it., This is a very sweet little watch, and is definitely worth the low price. My one remark is that the band seems unusually short. I have small wrists, and I have to use the 4th out of 7 holes to buckle it comfortably. I usually use the smallest or next to smallest option on watches. This would likely not fit someone with large wrists because the band is not long enough. Otherwise I love the rose gold color with the grey band. Plus the silver face makes it able to be warn with silver jewelry., But too small for my wrist, really sized for a woman's wrist., good morning I need to validate the tracking number that purchased the 28de January of this year, Plastic that holds the band on broke after three months since it is past the 30 day return can't do much about it very disappointing!!, Bought for $299, which was too much.  Chronograph did not function properly.  The one time I attempted to use the chronograph, the second hand failed to reline properly. Every time I used the chronograph the second hand would line up in random places, never at the 12 spot.  The buttons did not work on first push.  The watch dial was not very distinct.  I have a $175 Seiko and a $300 Citizen which are far better.  At the time I got the GV2, my wife got a Victorniox, which is far better.  I returned the watch after two weeks.  I would not recommend this watch., DO NOT BUY!!! Horrible-no instructions included and impossible to figure out how to set, I've been an electronic technician for 35+ years and I could not get this watch to work with my Samsung Note II.  Sent it back and exchanged it for a Pebble Time that I'm most happy with.., The alarm is weak, the numbers are difficult to see in the dark! Tried this for two days and it is a no go for me, My husband was very happy with his new Invicta., Similar to the original strap...but a little different., Clockwork Synergy is an awesome company with fabulous customer service.  Although I ordered the wrong width for two watch straps, Natalie in customer service went above and beyond what is usually expected.  She made it a personal mission to make sure I received what I had in mind originally.  The replacement order came in record time and the exchange was easy.  AND, the watch straps are of great quality and stylish.  Thank you!, its now my favorite watch!!!, I was worried about this watch for being a &#34;cheap watch&#34; Not at all! This is my everyday casual watch, and it is sturdy, amazing craftsmenship! The leather is wonderful, it molded in easily. The watch itself is fairly thin, with a perfect diameter! I love the watch!, Love this watch.  Fashion forward.  Nice leather band.  Easy to read face., I could not get the battery to sit properly in its holder. At one point I got it running, but then took it down to reposition it, and the battery jostled out of place again so that it did not chime. I could have worked with it more, but I bought it for the chime, and it's a loud chime anyway, that I felt wouldn't work in the kitchen where I needed it. Not a bad chime, but really ringing, so many people might like it very much. I returned mine., makes taking out watch links simple & easy.<br />definitely helps saves me $$$ from having to take it to a watch shop!, Does not fit all, So pleased with this product!!! It looks exactly like the picture and is really sturdy!<br />I love it!<br />the only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because the shipping took a while and I'm very impatient but other than that I definitely recommend!, I was disappointed.  The numbers are silver, not white, and were hard to read in some light conditions (near invisible at times).  Planning to send it back., Absolutely love this watch! Great face size, comfortable fit, and simple enough to wear with so much!, Contrary to good taste, I like the ticking sound. I don't find it to be audible beyond a pretty quiet room, but then I had my amps turned up way too high in high school.<br /><br />Looks good, easy to glance at, easy to set. Money well spent., not too bad, leaks like a siv though.  tends to jump dates and hours as your wrist will hit the buttons on the watch frequently., Everything was ok. I received the watch and it is working fine. It is absolutly silent. Thanks to the company for the concern. But the delay was because of the Mail Office in Uruguay., Work just fine. Saved me a trip to the watchmaker., Had a very large bracelet  that was impossible  to  adjust.  Beautiful  otherwise, just can't  wear it., Broken after two weeks., Light weight feeling on the wrist.Keeps time accurately.I find the juxtaposition of the Roman numerals and classic design with solar technology appealing., Gorgeous watch. Looks much more expensive than it is. 40 bucks and free shipping is a no - brainer. Sign me up, I'm in....., this watch  looks beautiful with vrry good details  the orange face really shines and on your wrist it looks like you are wearing a 500 dollar watch, It functioned normally for 2 years and died. I figured the battery had finished and I took for technical assistance to replace it. At that time I discovered that there was a problem with the clock and they charged me the value of the clock to repair. I did not do the repair and of course I will not buy any other Tissot., Comfortable, soft rubber. A little short if you have a large wrist., I got this watch on a &#34;deal&#34;from Amazon. I wanted a watch with Roman numerals and this looked like something I wanted to wear. It keeps the time accurately and looks good on my wrist. The only negative for me is the watch face is bigger than I expected it to be based on the photo. Other than that, I like the watch., Very lite and easy to read, Metal parts on the watch are rusted., This model ProTrek  is the latest and in my opinion the best version so far. Before purchasing you should ask yourself which of the model S3500-1JF types do you like. Choices include a silver outside ring with a normal display, a black outside ring with a negative (darker face) or this type... a black ring with the normal display. All three are the same basic watch but I prefer this particular type over the other two. I do own the silver ring model as well. The silver ring with normal display model usually runs about 100 dollars cheaper but for me this black with green accents version looks the best and the easiest to read The negative display version is just too hard to read for most people. The S3500-1JF has large, easy to push function buttons, larger number displays and more accurate readings for the altimeter, barometer and compass. The band is carbon fiber which from my understanding is more durable than the classic resin band on the US models. The watch also has sunrise and sunset times as opposed to other types that have tide and moon information. I find the sunset and sunrise information is more useful but you will need to research and determine your longitude and latitude so your can enter that information to make the sunrise/sunset times more accurate. The casing size is larger than most Casio watches but not unsightly odd. It looks great and sits very comfortably on my wrist. This watch is highly recommended and that comes from a guy that has many different types and models of G Shocks and A-B-C watches (ProTrek/ Pathfinder). This particular seller delivered fast and everything was packed well., super, nice rustic touch to it, thin leather material makes it very comfortable, I love the design of this watch. Really happy with the purchase. I didn't find instructions, but setting the watch is fairly simple. To change the date, pull the pin out to the half position (or first click) and turn counter-clockwise (this is the system for most watches). Also, it took me a second to realize you're supposed to put your hand through the inner loop before putting the band through the clasp. I hope this helps., Beautiful watch, This watch is very advanced and the initial set-up takes a few minutes to get everything dialed in just the way you want. However, once it's set, everything seems so simple. I'm able to have the larger numbers show me local time while smaller numbers show me Zulu time., The watch works perfectly & it is the genuine article!  It did arrive dead & I had to seek out a local watch maker to replace the battery, but the co play reimbursed me the cost of the replacement battery. ...just a bit of a hassel., It's perfect, I like it, This is an expensive, but very well-made watch band.  It definitely has a break-in period and it was somewhat uncomfortable the first couple of times that I wore it.  However, after about the third time on, it had started to mold to my wrist and has been comfortable ever since.  The kevlar is hard and not very flexible, but the leather on the inside is soft. The kevlar feels so tough, that I've joked that it feels like it could stop a bullet...not that I ever hope to be in need of that!<br /><br />Overall, the band is attractive and the stitching is done well. I put it on a Swiss Army/Victorinox Alpnach Chronograph and it looks awesome!<br /><br />I'm only knocking it a star because of the break-in period.  Other than that, it's a great watch band., Completely satisfied, Love this watch! It is big but not too big. It is very comfortable to wear and does not slide all around. The aqua face is so pretty and goes with a lot of colors in my wardrobe. Very happy with this watch., Swiss Legend makes excellent watches (I know because I purchased one for myself last year) and this watch is no exception.  As others have mentioned, it is a heavier watch made of stainless steel, but it looks great for someone who can wear it.<br /><br />You can swim with the watch, but not dive with it.  I have used mine while swimming and had no problem with it.  This watch also has a dependable clasp to keep it on your wrist.  I like the black face of the watch as well.  Most important of all, it does keep perfect time.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated by the dials - you can use them or leave them alone.  In my opinion, no one should downgrade a watch because they can't figure out how it works.  They all work if you take the time to learn about each feature.<br /><br />Highly recommended brand and watch.  Enjoy!, Excellent, Wicked cheap and really small.  Looks more like a woman's or children's watch.  Other then that, it's a watch, and it tells time., This sports  watch is so classic and unique! Goes with all sports attire!, The watch is neat looking and cool to my 13 year old. The problem is it isn't very functional. It is hard to read and hard to set up. Since it is all dots just doesnt make it practical. It also stopped working within a few months completely., Pretty! I was hoping the strap will be more than but it looks good! Hope my fiance loves it!, Excellent, thin profile watch. I bought this as an upgrade to the exact same watch in white color, and am very pleased. My old classic G-shock has never left my wrist and I have put it through pure hell. I expect the same from this watch and look forward to the atomic time features for traveling. If you have small wrists, want a thin profile watch that wont snag on things, looks good in work or dress, is totally shock or waterproof, works in freezing weather, takes a beating, solar capable and never needs a battery...then look no further. Living in the mountains, I would never pick anything different. The classic G Shock line in is the way to go!, Large and easy to read, with second hand.  Only drawback is that the dial is not lighted.  Comfortable, with nice leather band., Exactly what I expected, nailed it , useful for LG G watch, Got it for my daughter she love it I feel it was a good price also, It is too diferent, not like a photo.  Can I return?, I like it. Everyone noticed it, This is a fantastic watch for the money. My 7 year old son just loves it., I love this watch!  I Bought it for clinicals because I need a watch that can withstand a lot of handwashing and this one is water resistant to 100 meters, which means you can go swimming and snorkeling with it. It's functional, has the perfect size, matches with everything, and pretty to look at!  I love it!, I like it / I get several compliments about the watch.  Only downside - it is very heavy., Very good quality.  I wear this all the time now.<br />I don't see a lot of people wearing these kind of watches now. It's definitely something that's is classic and reliable., Beautiful Watch!  Easy to read ! Love 2 tone color!<br />Deb G., Good~~~, The watch looks very nice, however, it was $30 more expensive compared to other very similar Seiko 5 Sport watches, so I'm not sure it I paid the right price. Besides the price, the accuracy is extremely poor, there is a 5 min delay every 3 weeks, making it very hard to follow the correct time. If I could return it right now I will do it right away, it took me too long to notice this issue. Don't waste your money and get a different watch!!!, Nice color scheme (the white/gray dial is kind of fancy). The bracelet is definitely cheap but you can throw a replacement at any time (right now I am using it with a black/white/red NATO). The only con is that the bezel is a little bit misaligned with respect to the minute and hour markers. All in all a great diver for the price., Does not have a velcro strap as indicated, would be difficult for child to put on and off him or herself. Returned it for another Timex kids watch., gd watch from quality, quit working after about 2 months., LOVE this watch! It's as pictured on the site. It's a bigger, chunkier watch but that's what I wanted. The band is soft rubber and seems pretty durable. The orange is a great detail! Thank you!, ok, Omg this is worth every penny. My husband is in love with this watch. He slept in it on our anniversary night Omg., Love the way it looks and like the way it works.  The workmanship is great as well., Very simple.  Easy to use.  I had to youtube the instructions, but it was still very simple Now i can wear my watch comfortably., The watch is cute, but it has broken at the band 3 times already. We gave it to our child 3 weeks ago..., Elegant, I really loved the watch I bought it as a gift for my cousin and I am sure she will love it . Infact i ordered two other watches with this but now I am thinking of returning those two and order two more of these . One advice: its wont be so good for skinny wrists as it wont fit nicely . Its a really nice buy, It's a Mako. Enough said., The lighting that indicates the various times is brighter in some spots on the watch. Not the same brightness on all lines, This is a watch I've been wearing for over 7 years now, and I have recently decided to write some reviews of items that I bought from Amazon a while ago. Most of the reviews are from people who have recently bought the watch, so I hope I can provide a different point of view.<br /><br />I do own quite a few watches, I have a few Casios, Skagens, Timexs, a Tissot, a Pebble etc. This Seiko however, is my everyday watch.<br /><br />It is reliable, very light, and a good looking watch. I had to change the battery only once in the 7 years I owned it.<br /><br />At 37 mms, the dial is rather small, so if you have large wrist, you may want a watch with a bigger dial.<br /><br />I don't think the titanium band looks cheap at all, I think the color and the feel is just right. The only con I have for this watch is that it shows wear and tear. It scratches rather easily, but it doesn't bother me all that  I think it makes for a decorative look.<br /><br />The other thing I would have wanted from this watch is the water resistance capability. It is WR 50 meters, and you know what that means: Do not take it near water! I would not even shower with it. But it is all a trade off you see... You want a real water resistant watch, you get bulkier, heavier watches. I prefer the light weight for an everyday watch.<br /><br />All in an all, I gave this watch 4 stars after seven years. I would buy it again without any hesitation today if my old one had gone missing., Like the picture shows. Very happy with it., Sorry but it came with no directions on how to set the thing.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone., Battery was dead upon receipt, I really like this. It was great for the price. I love the color and face. It came on time, and working. The only thing is that it is a little too big, even on the smallest button., I bought this &#34;Hiwatch Silicone 50M waterproof Digital Sports Watches Date Time Alarm Week With Gift Box Black&#34; for my husband, who is deployed. He absolutely loves it. He is quite rough on any watch or electronic device that he has and they normally don't last long. The quality of this watch definitely feels as if it will last a very long time. I enjoy how it blinks with the seconds and does tell the day of the week with the date.<br />It has many size notches, which is perfect because my husband has tiny wrists for a guy. It lights up nicely and the tint that it came in he is reusing for his cigarettes so they don't get smashed in his ruck. Overall I'm extremely happy with this great and durable watch. I'll update if that changes, but I don't expect it to., Thank you, Can hear it ticking = too loud. Cute style., I love this watch. It has been more than a year and no complaints about it Everything in tact and perfect condition. Good Buy. :), product received in a timely manner and was exactly as described.  Will definitely order again!, Love this watch, am used to much more expensive watches, but this one is great for weekend wear. Super light, water proof, and if you lose it, $15 not the end of the world., I ordered this watch by mistake, thinking it was a womans watch because of the pink in it. I had to return it because it was HUGE. However it was beautifull and heavy. Wish it was in a womans size though., Excellent watch for price and is extremely stylish, Very nice band, but for an every day sporty watch that gets sweaty and wet on a regular basis, I would not buy. Like every other leather band I've tried, it will get a bit funky ( smell ) after a couple weeks use. I ended up buying an expensive natural ruber band. This doesn't look or feel as nice, but is completely water/stink proof., Thank you!, I like this watch alot. The only thing I don't like is that the strap is turning yellow., Many complements for a watch that was expensive., Watch face was very small, Thank you!, Bought this for my 16yo daughter. She loves it. It's a nice weight, the crystals really sparkle. I like the worry free stainless steel. Haven't read the itty-bitty paper to figure out how to set the small dials., I like it fine, but the band is too tight., Superb.  Inexpensive copy of a very expensive Bell and Ross., Chris.aquilina@btinternet.com they are a bit big for my arm, I like the quality, but only being able to remove 4 links is not good. It was an easy replacement on my LG G Watch R but after taking off the maximum 4 links, the watch band is still a little loose. Considering the android watch has a heart sensor, a relatively snug fit is a must., Gets faded quick with your own sweat, it is exactly what i expected, Excellent quality, The Casio Model DQ-750F Digital Alarm Clock is a great product with large clock digits (~1.2 inches/31mm height) and a beautiful blue/green electro-luminescent (EL) backlight.  It has simple controls that are very easy to set the time & alarm without reading the included manual and uses AA x2 batteries.  The alarm beep is loud enough without being too annoying.  I anticipate them to last at least 20 years like my previous Casio alarm clock that I finally had to replace since I wore out the setup switch since I constantly change my wake up time for weekday/weekend.  It is made in China like so many things. My initial delivery of two clocks were both defective with missing LCD segments.  Vendor was prompt to send out two replacement items which seem to be defect free so far. I would buy from Watchtonics via Amazon again.  Thanks to all involved!, gift for my girlfriend as a just because, and it got me &#34;just because&#34; adult things, Purchased this watch for US legend last February. It is one year old and is not working. They basically told me that they have a 15 day return policy and Casio has one year. Explained a G shock should last longer than one year and again was told they will do nothing. Not consumer friendly experience., This is a real man's watch. Love it, though it's a little big on my wrist it still look good., Fab!!!!, The watch is just beautiful! It came with instructions and also with their guarantee. It has the big dial that most men like. Once wound it  keeps  time for the whole day. The bracelet is solid.Under the dial you can see the heart of the mechanical system. It even has the manufacturer name engraved on the clasp and in the dial itself.The seller, ddshopping in China shipped my watch in only one hour! WOW!! They also personally sent me the tracking number and contacted me with updates as my watch went through both theirs  and the USPS delivery.Best of all, they ship by air to the U.S.A. A beautiful watch at a beautiful price! Top it off with a seller like ddshopping and you have a winning combination. A great item and seller for Amazon., My husband likes Puma and we've teased him lately (private joke) and to find this Puma watch was just the icing on the cake. He was so happy., I really like this watch!<br />Looks even better in person.<br />This is the second time I bought thru Amazon. This was so easy and convenient!, This is a very large and thick watch.  It's nice, but a bit too big for my everyday wear watch., Actually arrived in working condition.  Compliments on this one., They are nice and fits a small wrist. Love it  and would recommend it, I need to get the links removed but overall it's nice., Easy to use and see., I get a lot of compliments on my new watch.  It is a little awkward as far as the face size compared to the band size, but in the sunshine it puts off a great prism., looks very good... if it use bluetolth connection hardly (as example downloading new version of software)  then watch body can be enough hot ... but after 1st day of using (setup ne version , installing new software and skins etc) that situation was not repeat... batery is enough for 2 days (usually near 15% at end on 2nd day)..., Enter the water, Easy to program, looks cool and tough as nails so far. It's not too small in my opinion; feels about right to me. I'm 6'2&#34; and 220 lbs., This watch has everything that I was looking for and could possibly need in a watch. I have had it for about 3 months so far and continue to love it. Due to the multitude of features, it can be difficult to remember how to use them all, but the manual is very thorough.  Once you use it a few times, it is fairly easy to figure out, but all the features can be overwhelming at first.  The construction is sturdy and it feels solid when you wear it. The only drawback is that the band can sometimes be difficult to undo, but I think that is by design so the band does not become accidentally snagged or undone because the watch is meant to be used in rugged conditions.  Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about it thus far., Everything  broke first time out returned, I bought this watch at the beginning of the summer because I was going to be swimming all the time.  It is a wonderful watch and actually matches most of my clothes so it can stay on most of the time.  After reading the description and looking at the pictures it is just as expected.  Very happy!, Broke within the first 3 months of ownership.  The watch is nice, especially the skeleton winding mechanism.  Makes it a shame that the date dial broke off.  Additionally, the metal scratches very easily.  I bought it as a flash deal which leaves me getting what I paid for., This watch has a surprisingly solid build, strong materials, a decent band, and quite an attractive watch head.<br />'<br />Definitely not hollow feeling. The head feels sturdy, has a heavy feel, and has a nice shine The font and alarm hands are easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Modern, sleek, and looks great for every day use., Excellent, thank you, My 12 year old daughter was looking for something with the capabilities of the Timex Triathlon watch, but fit a tween-age girls fashion sense.  Black and purple, what else could you ask for?<br /><br />She uses the alarm and timer daily (tracking how much of her allotted video game time has been used) - and it was easy to learn and use.  Function and tween-age approval.  Perfect combination!, The item I ordered arrived earlier,watch band is silicone, very soft. 5 stars !, Well made with real leather and indiglo - a watch I can see both men and women liking, with a somewhat military appearance but also simple and stylish. However the battery was running down a month before I'd had it even one year. For all you out there who might not know - when watches began to be mass produced in the 70's, batteries were designed to last at 5 years or more. I had one watch that was still running after 7 years. One year is ridiculous., the watch is bigger than the illustration. after a month when I entered the pool water marks appeared unfurtunatly., I have it 4 stars because the only thing that I can say that I don't like about this watch is on the face the day and date Windows are very very small and difficult to read, I own other invictas and they usually have a small magnified bubble that allows you to see it. That's the only thing I dislike about this product, other than that it is a magnificent timepiece and very comfotabke to wear., Just what I was looking for., Like just about everyone else here, I love the watch and HATE the band. I've just had another rubber strap fail (perish around the sizing slots), having nearly lost this timepiece to the bottom of the ocean on several occasions! An the support from CITIZEN - utter utter utter RUBBISH!!!<br /><br />I tried to be too clever by half and ordered the steel bracelet for the BJ2105-51E (looks identical), but no dice, it doesn't fit! So now that I've basically purchased the watch twice with all the straps I've bought, this one is likely to be retired, unless I can find some clever machinist who can shape me some loops so I can attach a standard NATO strap. Such a shame Citizen...such a shame., I am VERY happy with my new Fossil watch. The watch is &#34;BOSS' with the blue dial and high quality black leather band which is retro 70's. (do you remember boomers?) The only negative is that it is a little hard to read even though the display is big during daylight as the colors and finishes kind of blend together. Also the hands are not illuminating in the dark. I thought they were supposed to be activated by the sun. But maybe its Seattle, it is sunny here now, but me, I avoid the sun a little so that might be it., The instructions for this watch are in tiny print and very confusing. There is a diagram of the watch face with the four buttons on the side of the watch. The diagram shows A, B, C and D. Then there is an insert that shows the purpose of A (Reset), B (Mode),  C (ST/STP), D (Light). I really like the light. Apparently, you to go through the whole sequence of changing the time to change the date. For my arthritic hands, it is very difficult to hold down one button, nevermind two buttons at the same time. I finally ended up, using a magnifying glass to see the instructions and making a word document in print large enough for me to see.<br /><br />It took me an hour and half to set the time. I was really interested in the alarm because I need a daily alarm but I am so worn out from setting the time that I am going to save that for another time.<br /><br />The watch is very pretty, I have had jelly watches before and liked the way that they look. It is also comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I would not recommend it for a senior citizen because of the size of the print of the instructions and the difficulty in holding the buttons., Thank you!, Bought this for my fianc&eacute; as an anniversary gift . he loved it ! and so did I . shipping was fast & free . so glad that I bought it .. it's a big smaller than the picture but if fit him perfect even a bit loose . loved how it looked on him ! !!!, This Swiss Legend is a beautiful watch, sure to impress the ladies and built to last a lifetime. When it was offered to me for the price of a review, I couldn't resist. However, if a watch originally marked at close to a thousand dollars is discounted down to $174.99  there must be a reason for it. In today's age of lightweight, waterproof watches that not only tell time but also monitor heart rate, count how many steps you walk, and countless other apps, this one is an old fashioned time piece with a few drawbacks.<br />The watch is not only heavy, but it is also bulky and awkward. If you're active and exercise regularly or do physical labor, the watch is impractical. However, if you're an international traveler and want a status symbol this might work. Another drawback is that the watch band is so large that it fits perfectly around my ankle so I'll have to take it to a jeweler to have links taken out of the band and wear it only for dress. So, whether or not you buy this watch depends on why you want a watch and your lifestyle., Very thick and beautiful., Light weight and easy the wear. The watch arrived quickly with the extra link in side the box rather than needing to be removed. I'll probably by another because it the most unique watch I've owned., I bought 2 of these, plus 2 more of the black ones, with the last one before that, they all &#34;reset to 00:00&#34; for some strange reason.  The time ends up being just slow enough to really make me late when I need to be somewhere on time. Would have given it one star, but I don't hate the watch.  This watch has been evolving since my first Casio in 81 or 82, and has everything I need in a watch. They need a harder glass on them to resist scratching too.  ¥¥¥, My watch is the 7016X model... only difference is that mine has a leather wrist band.  Was a great watch... for about 18 months.  In short order, the wrist band fell apart, the battery died and now it loses about 4 minutes a day.  Very disappointed. Will not buy a Wenger product again as I begin to shop around for a replacement., unique, a lot of winding up, but cool., thanks so much, im kind of a person who loves to acquire different kind of watches<br />This is my first time to buy a sport watch such as casio g-shock and i was amazed by alot of its features<br />To start with i loved its appearance and the combination between the black, gun metallic and the gold<br />The second thing i liked was that it has alot of function that helps me on my work, This was a gift...and I could not be more pleased. It is even more attractive than the picture, and the box it came in is very cool.<br /><br />Great value!, I knew it was big, and I'm okay with that. However, the hour hand only moves about a half an hour. So, major  function...track time accurately = fail.<br />Function...use for jewelry = pass.<br />Over all fail., I really liked this watch, nice piece, but, I wanted a white dial or face, I returned it, So far it looks good in the box, since I just received it, I haven't been able to see if it keeps time yet., Great looking  Watch But it doesn't  work. .. Not Happy about this  at all I need results. .. Didn't get results...  All I wanted was a replacement watch... Not a refund.... Clearly ....my money was wasted..... Never again....never again.  Worthless business practice ..... Trust is what I value....  In return ..... I got nothing.   Nothing...., the only thing I do not like is the weight. It is heavy,, works well, Nice looking watch, really durable and pretty much water proof if you don't dive too deep.  Perfect for keeping time while soaking in the pool or snorkeling in the ocean...which I did every day all day for a week on vacation and the watch was submerged or wet the whole time.  The watch still works great and looks good., The Casio watch is quite sophisticated: energy renewable and atomic precision. Unfortunately it is a little small for my eyes.<br />Size of the case is ~ 42 mm. Product arrives on time Return was processed quickly. I  already bought another Casio watch I can see numbers and characters.., Originally I really liked this pocket watch. After two weeks, I noticed it had stopped. So, naturally, I gave it a couple of quick turns. Nothing. I only gave it two or three turns, so there's no chance that I over wound it. It just completely stopped working. I honestly wasn't expecting much for $4, but I was kind of hoping it would last a few months. Oh well., Not your usual watch winder which mimics wrist movement, just rotates clockwise and counterclockwise, smooth action, I recieved this product in exchange for a review.  This watch is so cool. I love that it just looks like a bracelet unless u push the button. It was really east to set the time and when it shows the time ots very cool looking., Excellent piece.<br /><br />* Very elegant and sturdy design<br />* I love the fact that is not shinny, but a matte finish<br />* I like the color-line around it; It adds a very nice touch<br />* Cushions are also well made and soft, but do keep their shape<br /><br />The only concern I must express is that while all cushions are armed with watches, there seems to be a enought room/space for the watches to tilt to sides.  But this could be one's personal preference as some may find it a plus when pullling one the watch to wear.<br /><br />I certainly recommend it and would buy again both as gift and personal., The description of the watch says blue dial watch but when delivered it is black dial watch.<br />This is very dissappointing., I really like this watch its very stylish and classy. The only problem I have with this watch it's really loose on my wrist and I don't know how to tighten up the slack : (, Fantastic looking watch. Received item fast from seller and could not be more happy with my purchase. I have only been wearing for 2 weeks and I have gotten many complements on a daily basis. Also, Amazon had it cheaper than at other sellers., tools are only good to adjust metal strap.. not enough screws to open back case to replace batteries.., A battery is a battery.  It works., The strap looks great, but it must be really absorbent. Keep in mind, I wear it in a fast paced restaurant environment, so I sweat with it a lot, but it smells bad enough that I can't wear it anymore, and I tried to clean it thoroughly. If anyone has some advice on how to clean the leather I guess let me know?, Like the looks of the watch and use it on weekends, Delivered the item again after the first one was lost., Rough watch that broke quite easily. Felt very cheap, and watch face is big, like SUPER big., it's a very  nice watch and  easy to read the time with luxury sport style from Casio, Awesome watch. I changed the band to a black leather band with white stitching. Love it! Wore it on my wedding day., Excellent quality, Difficult to read the actual time but it's a nice piece., This is the Second Casio watch I've bought ! I love them they are long lasting and fashionable ! 😌, Excellent!, Arrived with a dead battery and had to pay for a new battery before could wear it., Sharp looking watch at reasonable price. No complaints., A+, I've owned this watch for a few years now and it's become my everyday go-to watch. I get compliments on it all the time, probably at least every week (which is probably why I like wearing it so much!)  I have a couple of other Android brand watches but this is by far my favorite!, Nice blue dial with good leather straps., thanks so much, Beautiful sounds., Nice automatic for the price. As always with Seiko, the lume is exceptional. The only con is that the hour hand is a little bit misaligned with respect to the hour markers., Very nice watch. Ver easy to set. Shipping Was fast, Solid with some limitations, concurred.<br />I second the referenced review, with a few added points:<br />-The packaging was indeed perfect, mine came in three separate boxes: an initial shipping box, a second packing box, and finally the product shoe-box type, which was enclosed by an inch of foam on both ends.<br /><br />-One note concerning the construction: while it seems that the drawers are permanently in place to hinder inspection of the entirety of the humidor's construction, I reached up under the top of the humidor and my fingers hit plastic of some sort. You'll have to decide if this is something you can live with, I personally don't see it as an issue when compared to glass top humidors.<br /><br />My specific product came with a few minor scratches on the top edges, but was otherwise mint. I have yet to season and put it to use, I will leave a<br />second review when this has been done.<br /><br />Overall first impression: a beautiful piece that fits the aesthetic theme of its surroundings. It is well and beautifully built, and will be nicely complimented with other additions from the same series., Love this watch! I have one in black and white. I beat the crap out of my watches. This one is soo durable and stylish! Great quality!, Excellent product, very fast delivery!, This muscular watch was just too big for my tastes - it seems to be designed for bigger wrists. I am average height and my wrist measures about 6-3/4&#34;, so the watch strapped in at the second smallest hole position. It would be too large for wrists under about 6-1/2&#34;. The watch case diameter is larger than specified, measuring 44.5mm diagonally across the face (so, not including the crown.) The case is nearly 11mm thick. It is heavier than watches I'm used to, weighing in at 2.5oz or 70g.  It is a nice, if oversized, looking watch. The numbers are clear and easy to read, including the date. The hands are only visible at the tips. The time could be easier to read if the arms were not black like the face, though., The watch is pretty awesome for the price.  I have had it for several months and it is holding up just fine.  The band and clasp are indeed &#34;cheap&#34;, but they haven't broken or shown signs of wear.  For the price, it's worth the purchase, it's a cool looking watch that if it breaks you're not out hundreds of dollars., Strap too small. Says men's watch but sized for a child. Had to change the band so would fit my man., Had bought an all black one that was outstanding and purchased this shortly thereafter.  Looks expensive for the price.  Would highly recommend., This timepiece is amazing., This band needs to clearly state it does NOT include the pieces needed to actually PUT IT ON THE WATCH! It's a nice enough band but I can't comment to it's comfort or anything having to do with wearing the band. For that I'll have to either spend another $10 for a tiny watch tool or take it to a jeweler. So right now it sits in the package. :-(, thank you, This watch is great and a fun way for my 7yr son to learn how to read a watch. It make telling time fun., have just had this a short time, but so far i am very happy with it. the big face design is just what i was looking for and the quality seems good. my son was visiting for the weekend and says he wants to get one-he is a watch aficionado ., beautiful, excellent product quality, AUTHENTICITY – Summary: Watch was purchased directly from Amazon, not a third-party seller, and is a brand new (unused/unworn) genuine Breitling. Of course since Amazon is not a Breitling authorized dealer, I knew I would not receive a Breitling warranty certificate.  (This also is why the watch can be purchased for $2800 less than dealer’s price.)  I was skeptical about buying a Breitling on Amazon, but I am glad I did. More details below:  The watch looked great, but due to prevalence of high-quality counterfeits sold through non-authorized dealers, and having never seen this exact model in-person before, I started to become suspicious of what I perceived as potential flaws.  I contacted Amazon concierge customer service, (which connects customers to USA-based Amazon representatives who attend to high-dollar item issues.)  The Amazon rep was very courteous and helpful, and stated that while she doubted that the watch was not authentic, I could absolutely return it for a full refund.  (I chose to purchase the watch directly from Amazon as the vendor, due to Amazon return policy and customer service, and I have limited experience with third-party sellers of watches.)  I wanted to verify the watch was genuine Breitling (or not) and, as I happened to be rather close to their location, I personally took it to Breitling USA headquarters in Wilton, CT where they confirmed the watch was an authentic Breitling!  (The Breitling customer service representative I had previously spoken to on the phone came down to greet me, and then took the watch to the watchmakers on-site, who determined the piece was genuine. The rep was extremely pleasant, polite and helpful, and although she stated Breitling could not provide me anything in writing to indicate or affirm the authenticity of the watch, they provided the inspection and confirmation of authenticity at no charge.) I would advise any buyer of a high value watch from Amazon to attain an expert inspection, either via the watch company themselves or an authorized dealer, prior to wearing the watch or having the band re-sized, just to be sure the piece is genuine. Bear in mind a dealer might charge a fee for the inspection.  WATCH APPEARANCE: Many photos of this watch can be found by doing an online image search. I want to provide some guidance as to the appearance of the black color of the bezel:  In most professional photos of this watch, including the one here on Amazon, the black bezel color looks like a pitch or “inky” pure black.  In direct bright light the color is closer to a dark charcoal matte grey.  In low or indirect light, the black does look more like “pure black.”  The point is that depending on the type of lighting, the black bezel color will look slightly different. This is not surprising since the material is actually black vulcanized rubber which is embedded in the bezel and completely flush with the stainless steel numeral markers. I've included pics of watch in different lighting.  ACCURACY: The watch's automatic movement is a COSC certified chronometer and should keep time within -4 / +6 seconds per 24 hours. I have had the watch 4 days, and it is running about 6.7 seconds fast after a 24 hour period (or .7 second faster than spec range.)  Various online watch forum discussions state that Breitlings need a few weeks or a month to “settle in” and many people have state their Breitlings started out fast but after a few weeks were within specification.  Others state watches should be within the COSC specification from day one.  Personally, I do not know which is true, but I’m hoping my watch will “slow down” just a little in the coming weeks.  Regardless, I can live with gaining 6.7 seconds per day.  The watch is beautiful and a delight to own!, Beautiful watch, appears to be well made, and everything works as it should. The watch was thoroughly packaged and well protected for shipping. So far, I'm quite pleased !, This is the second Bulova I've owned.<br />+Very Striking visually.<br />+Easy to set<br />+Comfortable<br />-Diamonds are SUPER SMALL.  Don't buy it for the Diamonds.<br />+/-The face being mother of pearl to me is cool, but not very noticeable.  Though it does look good when you do notice it., Good quality but only for women watches a bit on the small size, Way to big than in the picture, Excellent time piece, I got this watch for a discounted rate at Snagshout and I'm planning to give it to my dad for his birthday. It looks really neat and the design looks very elegant. Just from looking at it I think he's going to like it a lot. This is the second Akribos watch I've bought and I'm in love with this brand., It's fit very well!!, very beautiful watch, I only gave 4 stars because I would have like a little more size to the dial face. other than that its pretty nice, I get a lot of complements on it. the blue it nice and shine in the sun. I have to remove 3 links., Disclosure:This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I was really excited to receive this watch. I really love accessories made out of wood and have been looking at watches like this one for awhile. However, When I received the product I was disappointed. The watch I received looks like a cheaper version of the one pictured on the companies amazon account. The face of the watch i received looks to be a wood grain sticker and not actual wood like the one pictured on amazon. It also has a completed different wood pattern and the logo is on top instead of on bottom. I wish that the logo was engraved but that is just a preference that I believe would make the watch look more natural. The watch is light which is nice and the actual watch that houses all the components is real bamboo. However, I would like an explanation as to why the watch I received looks very different than the one pictured on the seller's account., It didn't work.  however, thanks to Amazon the problem was easy to resolve., Tremendous, This watch has survived A LOT of abuse and still works like a charm. The face is scratched a little from a few pretty bad falls but it's a minor scratch. There are a lot of holes in the band which is nice for someone with small wrists. The multiple timezones is also nice for someone who travels a lot. It takes a little bit to get used to navigating using the 4 buttons but that would be my only complaint. For the price, i don't think I could have gotten a better watch that suits the needs of a traveler., cute! adjustable too, I get a lot of compliments on this watch. It is large and heavy and good quality and design. That and the white color makes it stand out. I don't like the date dial. I personally cannot read the date because it is so small and the numbers are hard to figure out. It is also very easy to accidentally hit the day and date buttons and change the date, so they are never accurate anyway. But they look cool., Awesome #, I purchased two of these at two different times and both times the hard plastic part holding the rubber straps broke within a month or so. I wear my watches securely, but not tight and not too loose either. There's is no explanation for this, other than a faulty, poo quality product. One would have to replace the whole plastic frame holding the watch face and connecting the strap. Normally, I would try to gerry-rig it and wear it anyway, but you can't even do that, because the whole plastic frame broke: twice, with two different watches! This is junk, way too cheap. I will not purchase again and do not recommend it., Best looking most comfortable non-leather band I've found. I prefer leather, but they always end up a bit funky ( stinky) so I'm trying this. So far it's all good., The watch was a bit &#34;lightweight&#34;. I am used to watches that are somewhat heavier. However, it was cute and it worked., Possibly one of the most elegant Citizen watches I've bought. The face is more of a light grey than bright white, and the hands aren't quite as sharp blue as in the picture, but in person, I think it actually looks better (albeit a bit different) that represented here. I am very pleased with it., OK Besty Johnson is one queen of different love her fashion styles and this watch is soooooo dang cute and stylist, I received my watch strap in record time - only to realize I had ordered the wrong color.  I emailed Clockwork Synergy and quickly received a return email with a return label for the watch strap, and notification that the correct color had already been sent out to me!  The strap is beautiful and will definitely enhance my Pebble Steel.  I am also so impressed with the Customer Service - that's how to create and keep loyal customers!, This was a gift and well liked., This is perfect for an everyday watch! I also have the black leather strap model and love both just as much. Unlike several other reviews I haven't seen the wear that is supposed to have shown but the strap is rather dull so I'll keep it for now as a frequently worn but not everyday watch to kronor nice looking. I'd definitely recommend for your next watch purchase!, Beautiful watch for $95. I bought 2 more after for gifts after received the 1st one, My only problem with the watch is that it came with a different band than what is pictured, which is more of an inconvenience than anything else. Both the supplied band and watch feel and look like something of a high quality so this is a great buy for the price if the leather band doesn't bother you., Bought this for a friend a while back. The links keep falling apart. Cheaply made for what I paid., It fell apart immediately..., Really like this watch. I received a lot of compliments on this timepiece this past weekend . Nice looking watch !!, It's broken already after 8 weeks and I can't return. Horrible., I purchased this to replace one from a different company that broke.  I have had the new band on my watch for 2 days and.... one of the little straps came loose  and fell off.  Without these little straps to hold the end of the watchband in place, the watch band can easily come off your wrist., This is very affordable sport watch. I have been using it every time I do my running session and it is still working upto now., Wear it when swimming. Works nice.  Excellent watch considering the price., Superb watch at a superb price...In England this is almost double...although at the moment it's not available anywhere...but should you come across one..get it..It looks even more fabulous in real life then on the photo...I bought this to go with my collection and do not actually wear it...but I have on occassion and when I do someone always notices it and remarks on it...This is just a fablulous complication watch to be admired without doubt...VCheers, Beautiful piece!, Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. The band is somewhat big around his wrist though., Best watch I've ever owned. In fact, I'd like to add more Citizens to my collection., At the time of this review, the initial battery has lasted 3.75 years (still working fine). The timekeeping is very accurate on this watch, going multiple years without deviating more than a minute from actual time., This watch looks like, and is packaged like a $15 watch. Of course it isn't real gold, but the manufacturer couldn't even polish it. When it isn't polished it looks more like bronze, and when it is polished it looks clearly like fake gold, or at best crude gold paint. At first glance it looks fancy with a cheap pleather band, but when you look close enough the entire watch looks cheap. Even the case is cheap, with an ugly pillow that holds the watch. The packaging mine came in had what looks like dried glue staining it. If you get it for under $20 and it doesn't break in the first few months its not a bad deal. I only had mine for about 24 hours, so these are simply first impressions. It would probably make for a great first 'hand wind' watch. If you don't like the idea of winding your watch once a day after you've owned this one, then you probably wouldn't want a $200 investment that you would need to hand wind., The product picture is not accurate as the inner side of the leather is black instead of khaki shown here, though the watch itself is perfect., The watch itself is sturdy and beautiful. It can be a bugger to set but I got with patience.  The band is not nearly as dark as pictured.  In the pictures, it looks black  but the one I got is a medium grey.  I don't mind it has a worn look that I think looks good.  I do love the watch.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the band color., This watch really stands out and quickly became my go to watch. The face is really a brushed silver, something that is lost in all the photos and it is incredible. The red layer beneath provides great accents. The size is just right, big enough to feel, thicker than it looks, but not overwhelming. I highly recommend., sharp timepiece, I liked... But its not small. A bit large, not as delicate as it could be, Beautiful watch.  I love the color of the face (light gold).  Easy to read., It is an excellent time piece, This is a nice looking watch, however in the sunlight there is a strange shadow across the face of the watch. It's a little disconcerting and odd looking and I've never had a watch with this issue before.<br />If it weren't for the odd behavior in sunlight I would give it 5 stars, The clock didn't work, very poor quality. You couldn't even adjust the time on the watch. and after I tried to adjust the time the second hand fell off. If I were you I would look somewhere else for a watch., If you love the G-Shock watch like I do, and your wristband has broken and you can't get the<br />someone. This is the band to get, find the color you like and install. &#34;Some model's may need adapter&#34;., it meet my expectations and also i received it on time, Spring on band broke out after a week., I bought this watch for my husband & he loves it.  The band was large though. Did have to take some links out of it., Yep, cheap watch. The pin on the strap came off about 2 days in. Had to get a new one and superglue it in.<br />The watch is NOT GREEN, it is turquoise - does not even remotely look like the picture - at all.<br />So, you get what you pay for - it is a funky cheap watch that is a totally different color than advertised., I can't get this watch to set to the correct time. All the directions are in a different language (other than English)., Having issues with the day selector, the date is correct and spins correctly, the day selector, not so much. The day (when attempting to change what day it is) clicks while it spins but it does not change the day in the display. The hands do not &#34;charge&#34; unless light is applied directly to the face of the watch, it does not solar power or charge off of regular light. When it does charge after light being applied, it dies out quickly and does not stay illuminated for very long (maybe 20 minutes at best). I purchased this watch as I am a paramedic student, and will only be using it for the second hand. Just upset that $ spent on the watch and have only wore it for less than 1 day and its not preforming.<br /><br />UPDATE: Date does not change, Amazon sent the replacement, that was sticky, and has a dead battery in the watch, needless to say it is being returned to Amazon., The watch has a prism like glass face which reflects light ,making it difficult to see both hands of the watch as the same time., Bought this band for an LG-G and it fits perfectly!, tooooo small to see!!!!!!!, So far so good.  Had it for a couple of weeks or so now and it seems pretty good.  Looks decent and the price was really cheap (around $16.00).  I go through watches quite often, maybe once every few years due to the type of work I do.  They get beat up pretty good so I don't like to spend too much money when I need a new one.  I have been buying Timex (in the $25-$45 range) for many years so now trying the Casio.  Time (ha ha) will really tell how great of a watch it truly is!, Really well made, looks like it was designed for the watch. Wish it was a little more adjustable...say in the buckle. That being said, I highly recommend this as an alternative to the stock band. I'm wearing it right now!, works well, This watch is awesome!, For whatever reason, it doesn't keep track of the day properly. It seems to flip the day every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours, not sure why. The watch looks nice, though, and keeps the time reasonably well., Thanks, Simple classic watch. Just the right size, I love this watch! The dial is perfect.The &#34;day&#34; is showing in big letter and easy to read. It has also Radium in hour and minute hand so time can be read even in the dark., Beautiful watch. It is accurately described in the listing. AND it came NIB new in box. The box was not previously opened as some from other sellers.<br />It contained all of the &#34;papers&#34; that a buyer should receive.<br /><br />Buy it, you will be happy, I've never had a problem with Timex Iron Man watches, I loved that this one is small and dainty., worked for me, This is a beautiful watch; I was disappointed that it didn't work.  Amazon replaced it at no charge immediately. The replacement watch didn't work either. No problem returning them and credit was issued in just a few days. I assume the batteries were dead., I need a watch that shows both day and date.  This is the best I have found. Well built, good looking and displays info in the background to the analog display., I own several fine watches and needed a work watch or two. This caught my eye and I gave it try. Not disappointed at all, fact is a little impressed with some of the detail work and general look of the piece as well as quality. I have been let down by Invicta products in the past and this seems, at least these past days I have been using it, to be at least equal to those. Time will tell (pun intended). Of course the idea that I should get a work watch to do hobby tasks speaks volumes also, who wants to tune a car with a Rolex on or  garden in the mud with an Omega much less clean out gutters while enjoying a Tag Heuer. This watch, no matter the roots, seems just fine and I have people notice this much more than the others, odd don't you think. So Stuhrlung keep doing what you do., just what I wanted, This watch is pretty but the time keeps stop stopping in have to always be touching the knob to Start it, I'm need  watches, The watch band is ok and is an improvement on my old band, the band is completely brush finish - nothing is mirror finish.  I guess this is good for hiding scratches, but it doesn't look striking, like mirror finish stainless.  The clasp is stiff and difficult to open.<br /><br />The gold links look good., save your money this product is not worth it, Returned not what I was looking for, would have paid more if it came with a vibrating box so you dont have to reset it every day, what a pain, Really a great looking watch.  I like Swatch skins generally and their chronographs specifically.  This one is easy to read and striking in black and white., This was a gift for my son and it's still working as expected. The watch is quite good and my son loves it., awesome watch, The watch looks very lovely. I love it. The strap is not hard like the strap of a stainless steel watch. This one's a bit hollowish. But still a great product for the price. Looks very elegant., Super!!! Very beautiful!, Best watch I've ever boght.Many useful functions like Tough Solar Power,automatically back light,6-Band Atomic Timekeeping,200m water resistance......, Good looking Swiss watch with a comfortable strap. It has luminous hands and beautifully designed. Loved the &#34;8&#34; motives., This watch is NOT NAVY blue....It is a bright ROYAL blue! I need a navy blue watch...Color is NOT as shown!!, Excellent quality watch band. Top-notch leather, perfect stitching, padding and finish. Very nice patina right out of the box, and looks understated but definitely quality ... not a particularly dressy band, would work well on casual / sport style watches best, IMO.<br />I put it on a decent quality $85 casual watch (as in wear with button up shirt with khakis, nicer jeans, etc), and this band definitely &#34;upgrades&#34; the watch. Very pleased.<br /><br />Note on sizing: I got the &#34;regular&#34; length, and my wrist measures 7-1/2&#34; (wrapped a piece of string around wrist at the point wear watch is worn, then measured the string) - and I am using the 3rd hole from the end, which leaves just enough band to make it through the leather 'loop' ... in other words, any shorter and it wouldn't work. Hadley-Roma makes bands in &#34;Long&#34; length as well (about 1/4&#34; longer I think), and that might have been better, but I couldn't find the MSM882 in 'Long' and I really liked this band.<br /><br />That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of these bands again. beautiful band, very classy and understated., Back in the 1980s, all digital watches came with little lights on the side that illuminated half the screen. Then, Timex came out with Indiglo, and it was a pretty blue light that lit the whole watch! It was amazing. Thereafter, all the illuminated watches used the backlighting, now even the cheap knockoffs. But, no! Not Casio! They doggedly kept to the little side light. It's gotten a little brighter, but it still is focused on part of the screen, creating a lot of glare against the glass.<br /><br />The description says &#34;EL backlight with Afterglow&#34;. I assumed/hoped this meant that the whole watch was brightly lit from the back, not a side light. (I also thought EL might have something to do with EL wire or EL paper, both of which have pretty glows). Sadly, it was not. The light is somewhat brighter than I've seen before, but I'd still prefer the full backlighting. Also, it doesn't stay on while you hold it down. After 1 second, it turns off automatically and you have to push the button again.<br /><br />Other than that, the watch is fine. I can change the time, use the stopwatch and timer. I had to look in the manual to find the 4 additional alarms; the interface isn't very intuitive. (The upper right button seems to be labeled &#34;autorepeat&#34;, but really only controls the light).<br /><br />There are a bunch of indicators on the face of the watch - I haven't figured out what all of them mean yet. In addition to the seconds listed next to the time, there's also a bar that fills up every 10 seconds. I believe the circle in the upper left shows which of the 5 alarms are on. There's a place that shows whether the first alarm is in snooze mode (it's the only one that can snooze). There's also a repeat cycle, which I assume is for the timer and/or stopwatch. I have no idea what &#34;SIG&#34; represents. So, there's plenty to entertain yourself by trying to figure it out.<br /><br />This is going to be my camping watch, so I don't need it to be amazing. For $13, it's pretty good, aside from the stupid light., Excellent product., I bought this to replace the same watch my wife received from her step mother.  It is an excellent copy with the second hand added.  That is good.  The negative is I could find no way to adjust the expansion band, so I took the band off the old watch and put it on the new one., It's a nice watch, but small.  If it were bigger it would get more stars.  I love the Swatch quality, though., This watch is really beautiful in person. Subdued but regal shade of blue, & nice finish on the band. Very happy w/ this purchase., It fits nicely. Large face for reading the time, important for me. Neutral color goes with everything!, Cute watch but falsely states it has luminous hands. It does not., this is a big, beefy watch that weighs almost a pound...<br /><br />designed for left-handers, this timepiece features a stopwatch button, time/date crown, reset button, synthetic sapphire crystal, second, minute and day wheels, along with analog hour and minute hands, and a sweep second hand for the stopwatch feature<br /><br />press the bottom button to start the stopwatch from the 12 o'clock position, press again to stop; press the top button to reset and the sweep hand will rotate back to noon - very nice!<br /><br />beefy band in brow leather - comes in sturdy box w/instruction booklet; face and back are covered in shipping film<br /><br />i'm taking off a star for poor, inconsistent luminescence on the dial (splotchy coverage), The band seems nice, the pins it comes with are too big to fit my watch., This is lightweight and pretty cheap quality but I didn't really expect alot at this price. Keeps accurate time. Chain appears nice., The strap is very heavy and appears it will be super durable. Downside for me is that there was not quite enough space under the pins of my watch to install such a heavy strap. I had to mark the spot on the strap that would be under the pin and clamp it in a vise to create a sharp bend in the strap to fit it under the pins. I have no doubt that the pins would snap before this strap would ever break., This watch is beautiful. I have gotten plenty compliments in a wide array of places including Best Buy and the subway. The watch is subtle but unique. Who needs or wants a big sparkly watch, when you can have this! The face is a perfect size and the strap is different yet comfortable. I thought it would get itchy and uncomfortable over time, I actually proactively bought a second wrist band but I've had this watch for 9 months and have experienced no discomfort whatsoever. Lastly the best feature of this watch is the solar power. I hate when I'm going to an event, put on my watch and it's not working!! With this watch I never have to worry about that. If you are in need of a watch, this product will not let you down!, Not comparable to my other casio pro trek. This one is all plastic and not the same plastic that I'm expecting from Casio Watch., It's so beautiful and do not require a battery!, Nice every day watch. It's strong and flexible. The band is not an issue to me at all unlike some reviewers complain about but I think I will replace it to make it look more expensive., strap broke before 3 months, The only thing this watch is, is heavy. Could tell it wasn't black originally and has been cheaply painted. I don't know how it tells time because I had two watches shipped to me that didn't work. Extremely frustrating and inexcusable. Will not be buying from Uniprod again!, Love this watch. I like it like I do my Rolex president. This one is a gift. She loves it too. We never take them off, dishes, bathing or swimming in the lake. They are great, very reasonable and light on the wrist. You don't even know you're wearing it. See lives the black face. Mine is the pink face. This brand keeps perfect time and wears well. Way worth the money!!!, Actually, my friend has just bring my watch. He has already returned back from US. But the watch does not working, I am too disapointed for this., Nice watch.  I would like the digital display to be a little larger, but otherwise great watch, I love this watch it is just the perfect size.  And great quailty.  I have a small wrist and I like how it looks and fits., Larger than 393 battery I removed.  Will not fit, therefore I am stuck with it., Warranty web site was awful. The only way to submit warranty was through the mail., Perfect, The leather is of the highest quality and very comfortable. I was seeking a replacement for a nylon web band on my watch, and this item exceeded my expectations. The fit is perfect and the color is a nice shade of brown., Very elegant! It also fits girls. My 11 years old girl loves it!, Beautiful watch. Love the band.  So easy to latch. I just need to shorten it a little, No even a week and these junks broke ! The gild was is so yellow you can tell it's so so so fake looking & they are really light in weight so you can feel it's cheapness, nice looking watch.  I like its simplicity and classic design.  It's bit heavier than previous watches I have had and I had a hard time taking the segments off to adjust to my wrist size.  But in the end I am happy with it., This is going to be a short review. The hardware (buckle and pin) is decent. The colors are vivid with the a camo pattern reminiscent of the British army DPM camo pattern. Unfortunately, the band itself is so stiff that I found it very uncomfortable. This is supposed to be silicone, but felt like a poly strap in it's stiffness. The band itself is thick and perhaps that contributes to the rigidity. I do not recommend this product and give it only two stars., awesome workmanship., Watch is beautiful and dressy. Beware it weights one pound. And is the largest watch face I own. Noe problem taking links out myself. You get used to the weight., It was for a gift, and it really made its purpose.<br /><br />It is sturdy, has a nice weight and size, and really shines, especially de crystals inside, which my wife love.<br /><br />Really exactly as published and shown in the pictures., Excellent watch, The face is too small for me to see clearly., I waited almost a year to post a review, I wanted to be SURE!<br />WHAT A GREAT DIVING WATCH!<br />  *  Good looking<br />  *  Feel like quality product. It is heavy and solid.<br />  *  Bracelet can expand to go over your wetsuit<br />  *  Keep accurate time<br />  *  Price is incredably low for what it offers<br />  *  You are buying the equivalent of a $1,000 + diving watch (the one which are automatic - This one is a &#34;Solar&#34; and the solar is perfect even after a few days in the dark... Not once I had to adjust the time.<br />  *  The hands are wide and very visible when diving.... I did not try it a t 200 meters!<br />  *  The 3 screw buttons work very well and are effective not allowing any water in. Some review have complained about them... just be gentle and do not force them. Because I used the chrono all the time, I have to screw and unscrew them several times a day.<br />THE CHRONOGRAPH<br />  *  Well, I am not as positive, BUT I keep my 5 stars because it works AND I consider that at $200, I did not pay for it. Kind of a freebe.<br />  *  The Chrono works well but the priority (rightfully) was given to diving.<br />  *  The stopwatch's big hand for the seconds is excellent. However, after one hour it stops. So you are limited at timing anything within an hour only and the small dial giving you the elapsed minutes is small. Further more, because the 2 hands giving the time are so wide (good for diving), they often block the view of the dial (at 6:00 and every 30 minutes).<br />  * Seiko should have done a better job with the 3 accessory dials: 1) The one counting the seconds is good. 2) The one giving you the Military time is useless for me. 3) The one giving the elapsed minutes (chrono) is very hard to read and limitedto an hour.<br />  *  Some review have said that the day is hard to read. Yes, but how many time you need to look at your watch to see if we are the 4th or the 5th of July?<br />Bottom line, despite my comments, even the chronographis usefull and I use it several times a day.<br />NOW WE ARE IN 2017..<br />I have worn this watch almost on a daily basis. Even when I do not use it for a few days, it does not stop for lack of light. I never adjusted the time.<br />Yes I put it through the ringer, not only by using it, showering with it almost on a daily basis but also doing extensive snorkeling, diving with the sharks in the Galapagos, the turtles in Hawaii, AND NOW, how is my rating?<br />SAME. FIVE .<br />The watch still looks like new and all my above comments still stand. Some people have said it is heavy, for me it is a sturdy watch., The watch is beautiful, keeps perfect time and looks like a mans watch.  It was a birthday present to my self., I´m almost blind so I picked this watch out of all the watches out there.<br />I simply love it. I can finally see the time :) Plus people keep commenting on my watch and ask where I got it., Arrived on time.  Works as described., Very strong glass, its really beautiful and sturdy, lasted about 3months before one of the bands sloped off :/ but it was very very nice having. Fixible problem but kind of a hassle., I have a pretty large watch collection but ever since this one came in the mail, I can't get enough of wearing it.  It is perfectly big and unusual looking, very different from my other watches.  The vertical striping on the dial and the skeleton workings are just lovely.., The watch head looks great. I've received several comments and compliments.<br />The leather band and the metal fasteners feel cheap and are difficult to fasten. The leather looks okay.<br />It's a mechanical watch and must be wound every morning and the time reset.<br />Unfortunately, the time quickly gets out of sync. I'll compare the watch to my phone and by noon it will already be slow (or fast) by 15 minutes.<br />So, as a watch, it's useless unless you want to repeatedly reset the time. Essentially it's jewelry for men.<br />Can't complain for the price and I'll still wear it because it is eye-catching. Too bad I can't rely on it to check the time., Although I loved this watch at first I have been really disappointed in the discoloration of the metal that I thought was meant to be really high quality. I'll probably have to end up getting a new watch soon., Great watch for the money. This is my second &#34;Weekender&#34; watch as I damaged my first one after five years of use. I removed the strap as my personal preference is a twist-o-flex stainless band. The night light feature comes in handy on dark late nights during camping trips!<br />Highly recommended for an every day time piece., The watch stopped working right away., Best value out there. This thing is handsome and indestructible., Awsome so far....excellent replacement. Package also came with unexpected  pins and pin tool.  Prime shipped perfectly....  thanks Timothy, This is a really good simple watch. It tells the time and the date. What else would you want.<br /><br />Watch looks adventuresome, but not too much. Like the outdoorsy clothing line of the Gap. I like the strap for its feel and surprising durability., I bought this to use on my Basis Peak watch. I switched the pins from the Peak strap to this strap & it works just great! I'm very happy with my purchase & might decide to order in other colours!, Classy, clean watch that's perfect for a dressed down look. It's cheap, yet reliable. I love it., I wear this watch every day. I like it for is simple useful design. It is also very light weight. My favorite part of the design is the braded metal band. All in all a great watch for the money, Yes like very much, Please keep in mind, that when rating my DOM Watch with 5 Stars, it is a relatively new purchase of only a couple weeks. The main reason for my purchase is that not only the watch, but the band as well in made using Tungsten Carbide. I normally have to purchase a new watch every 6 to 12 months because of how worn and scratched the watch becomes. I purchased a wedding ring made of Tungsten Carbide from Amazon for the same reason. That was a year ago and there is not one scratch on the ring and it appears just like it looked when I purchased it. If this DOM Watch holds up as well as my ring has, I will be extremely happy with my decision. Happy Shopping! Kenny ~ Baton Rouge, Beautiful watch! Thank you!, Even though it is a nice looking watch it is difficult to program and read., This watch is so cool, This is a watch for a child, I bought it because it reminded me of a basic casio watch I bought for my dad and he enjoyed it simple designe and utility.  But this watch is too small for a man., Fits well but looks cheap!, Very nice watch for the price. My husband has a collection of Invictis. Watches and he is very pleased with this purchase at an amazing price., It is too lightweight and too small., My husband loves his new watch.  He wears the watch out in the field, in daylight mostly but likes the illuminating hands when he has to be out in the dark. Was a little worried about the color but was true to the picture.  Looked out some really expensive watches but was worried as to how they would handle being in the field.  This watch has held up so far and was a great price., like watch however stem pulled out adjusting date., Beautiful watch. Arrived sooner than expected. A little large for a small wrist but overall great choice. Original but still classy., The crown and pushers screw down for water resistant.  Very heavy, band is made for someone with a large wrist but can be adjusted.  The crystal backing is a very interesting feature. The blue face isn't necessarily my preference but it works with the gold color of the case and band. The chronograph, day of the week dial, continuous second dial, accumulate minute dial all work flawlessly. The chronograph is capable of two types of time keeping. The names elude me but one mode simply accumulates time as you start and stop the timepiece, the other pauses the hand while the timepiece continues to keep time and then winds the hand to the current time once you un-pause the timepiece., I like it., broke when dropped on tile, It looks like the Panerai Luminor Marina This is a solid time piece with good material. It doesn't appear cheap. Very good looking watch, real impressive looking,  Glows at night and I've had it for months now and the key to it losing time is initially Shake it to getting going , then wined it.   Overall very nice for what it cost and nice looking.  Very glad I purchased and to the seller, thank you!!!, The &#34;white&#34; wears off and ends up looking dingy and dirty. It looked so neat when new but I ended up throwing it away. Not happy...., too small face not what i wanted, Only band to fit my Casio G-Shock properly. Very comfortable and looks very nice. amazon service is great  - very fast!, 4 starts because it came to me with a dead battery.  Fortunately, I have all the tools and batteries so it was an easy fix.  Nice watch, but pretty big.  Everything functions as it should, and it keeps very good time. Not for a &#34;dainty&#34; wrist., This watch is beautiful! Well made, easy to take on and off. And doesn't feel too heavy or feel like it's in the way when I wear it. I haven't worn a watch in years and this one is comfortable and I actually like wearing it! The floating crystals around the face of the watch are bright, and eye catching. Just and all around great watch that I am very pleased with., Great looking watch.  However, after less than two months the hours hand inexplicably broke off and unfortunately I am past the 30 day return period.  Very disappointed., Does the job.  Tells time and has a stopwatch all in a decent size package., very nice packaging and good quality as mentioned<br />but small note : the watch was working which consums the battary, Kids love there new alarm clocks and are getting up for school on there own., This is a great watch and i really like the band.  I would like to order different colored bands - hope timex will offer someday!!, It's not glass, it's a plastic cover  . Very deceiving. I guess you only get what you pay for. False advertisement. Never buy  from this company again. Don't be fooled. They lie., this sucks, it was a gift and deliver very fast. everything looks good and prefect. Thanks., For the price it's great, mine went about 10 minutes each day too fast, but that's better than being too slow. Also the band broke off but I just bought a new set from China for 2 bucks and I should be set for next time. (I expected the cheap band) It looks cool and steam-punk, just don't brag since up close it looks very fake. However most don't care much for it, but some like the look of it and point it out. It's discreet enough not to be distracting. I would wear this watch only on some occasions, but i did not use it everyday., Kids love there new alarm clocks and are getting up for school on there own., Received right on time. But not what I really wanted so I am going to return and get a better one., Excellent, thank you, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  The band is not very long.  It's too long to not wrap but too short to wrap almost 2 times.  The stripe with diamonds attached also are coming unglued., With 3 alarms, a timer that can be set beyond 1 hour, easy to push buttons, bright light.... The only thing I don't like is the Velcro band which can ruin some fabrics. No big deal, replaced with a buckle nylon band. Also nice the alarm is not as high pitched as typical digital watches., Its so pretty ., Perfect size for a woman's wrist. I have a complaint about the condition that it arrived. Usually watches come with a clear plastic cling cover on their faces and this one did not. And, there was no foam padding around the watch. Maybe Casio doesn't do this with their cheaper watches? Also, the framing around the face is scratched as if this were a returned unit being resold. Since I only paid $10, I guess I'll just leave it at - you get what you pay for but I'm not exactly happy. Not sure if this is an Amazon warehouse issue or a Casio issue., wear it every day, I just love this watch. Its my everyday watch. I always wanted a victorinox and i'm very pleased with this beauty. Its very heavy (witch i love) and the size is jut right. I will def buy more victorinox. HIGHLY recommended., Exactly what I was looking for, Gorgeous watch ! Gorgeous packaging!, Like the flywheel style bezel! For the price, I'm actually surprised the band is durable and still looks good. I get nervous about the metal quality of cheap watches but, in 6 months, this one has not tarnished. It's powered by kinetic movement and has to be reset it everyday after inactivity, so it's okay if it gets off by a few seconds. This isn't an aviator watch. Don't expect it to be the world's most accurate timepiece., Solid, reliable Timex watch.  Similar to the first watch I had roughly 25 years ago., Nice, Solid but not too heavy, Distinctive, would recommend., This watch looks nothing like the picture.  It's much smaller in size than depicted and it looks like tin instead of stainless steel.  I returned it., I first owned this watch about seven years ago and it worked great. As others have commented, it's nice to have a countdown and a traditional stopwatch feature. Display is easy to read. I lost the first watch and have ordered two replacements within the last year and both have had issues. The first one was not waterproof: after only wearing it swimming at the beach and also in the shower, the case began to fog up and eventually the watch conked out. Luckily, that watch was still under warranty. The replacement sent from Amazon, seems to be waterproof, but has the annoying habit of randomly resetting itself to the date &#34;Friday 1  1&#34; (year 2010) and the time to 12:00 am. NOT the quality that I expect from Casio. Too bad, this used to be my favorite watch! I'm beyond the warranty period so won't be able to get a replacement. Needless to say, I won't be ordering a new one., Awesome in little words, very happy with it, Wore it once for about 6 hours and had to reset the time four times! It was brand new! Looks nice though., I purchased this watch for $14 and it shipped in about a day and arrived in two weeks. Impressed by the quality for such a low price. The strap takes time to break in and the winding dial is kind of loose. If you are looking for a watch to wear everyday this is NOT the watch to get. It looks great but will break if stressed too much, and is perfect for an elegant watch to wear at important events., I'm not happy with this watch.  The band's keeper straps is stretched and about to break already.  The numbers aren't as easy to read as I had hoped for counting heart beats with a stethoscope.  It's lack of a date make this watch less than ideal.  I wish I had bought something else., Great Watch. FYI, you need to read the instructions. Looks nice for the money., Works as advertised., I have been searching for a slim, versatile, and good-looking watch for a long time now and I can't believe I was looking to spend a lot more money when I found the perfect watch for about $10 bucks!<br /><br />I have a smaller wrist and this watch just looks absolutely perfect.  I have a larger G-SHOCK but I just find it to be a bit awkward because it is much thicker.<br /><br />The strap on the F91W-1 is so thin and sleek that it wraps over my wrist with no ugly gaps.  Also, when I lay it down, it lays flat unlike the G-Shock which I have to set down sideways because the strap curls.<br /><br />The display of the F91W-1 gives me all the information I need and nothing more.  There are some displays that have annoying counters that just seem distracting; this watch does not.  I am very happy with this purchase and I wish I bought this watch sooner.<br /><br />The only thing that I can nitpick about is the fact that the light should be blue instead of green and it illuminates the left side stronger than the right.  Not a big deal but it would make the watch even better.<br /><br />Highly Recommend!!!, Wrist band at pins broke within 2 months. Good watch, too good for cheap, shoddy craftmanship of plastic band. Not happt, save your money for better quality., Okay, I just got in the mail today and loved so much that I already had it sized at nearby watch store.  It is a beautiful timepiece that I plan to adore for years.  I was looking for a chunkier watch to wear with jeans and mostly black outfits.  This pic doesn't truly do it justice.  My wrist is a size 6 and the watch looks great.  Everything comes together just right!!!, I Like it a lot!!!, Love this watch! So glad I purchased it. This particular watch could not be found in any local Michael Kors store, so I was a little nervous about purchasing it online. What a pleasant surprise when I opened the box. It's absolutely stunning... as pictured! I had to have 3 links taken out for a perfect fit. I am a satisfied customer!, Real quiet motor that I never noticed moving at all.  Its seems like solid wood from its heavy weight., Nice buy, good value.  It is not a perfect fit for my LG watch., Good watch, kinda hard to set up. But you'll get the hang of it, it even tells the date!, color is a bit light. darker brown would be more like original tag heuer band, Casual for every day use, The clock is of good quality but not practical! It is very difficult to see the time and always have to turn on the backlight to see well. Disappointed ....., Broke the first time I wore them!, Looked much more plasticky in real life than in the pictures. Also a bit harder to see. I sent it back, but it is still an ok watch., As I had hoped, the watch is purple and black, not blue. I have small wrists, its slightly large, which I dont mind. The #'s are purple also. Im very happy., Fantastic...Until it stopped working...Ordered in August of 2015 the watch is dead by May 2016...<br />Not eligible for return. Yep, so, piece of crap...save your money., happy with purchase! beautiful watch, This probably won't matter to most guys buying this band but, the shortest this band can be adjusted to is 5.5 inches.  On a large watch, this could make the total circumference 7.5&#34;<br />For all the skiny guys here, I wish all the sellers of these metal bands, would clearly indicate the smallest these bands are able to be adjusted to, in their description to avoid the guess work., The mesh braclet needs a better way to stay latched with the two sliders they don't hold the band, This watch was a total waste of money.  The instructions are very vague so we couldnt even get it to do what it was supposed to and then soon after it quit working completely.  Even after charging for several hours, it will not even come on.  Horrible., beautiful watch. the first one fogged up in water but the second is working fine., It was advertised as having a &#34;Luminous Dial&#34;but this watch is not luminous<br />maybe it was at one time but not now VERY DISAPPOINTED !!, Decent inexpensive watch for someone looking for this nice gold-tone and brown band combination. Initial problem with order was resolved very courteously and satisfactorily by seller., The velcro strap is very difficult to clean. It smells really bad after I wear it when sweating at all. I am looking for a replacement strap that is plastic or resin. I do not have sensitive skin but the strap is giving me a rash. The watch itself has been working fine so far, but I should add that this watch is not unisex, it is feminine looking. I have very small wrists for a female and the watch face is slightly bigger than I would like, but it is too small to look unisex on a man., The band is extremely stiff. I had to burn the holes for the clasp to catch. I think it will be an ok band, but if i did not have a torch and tools to fabricate a descent hole for the clasp this band is not worth the money., we ordered this band and it was so stiff, in exactly 10 days from purchase, the band snapped and is falling apart! 'Genuine leather'… really?, It fits him great, looks cool, waterproof, and has a stopwatch too! It lights up and displays not only the time, but the calendar date and day of the week as well!, A beautiful watch.  Well made, attractive, and looks good in either casual or dress settings., Thank you!, This is my 2nd watch ... I replaced the first one I bought almost 15 years ago. The rubber part that attaches the watch to the band finally just fell apart.  The watch itself never has to be set, never has to have a battery change.  I'm pretty rough on my watches ... I owned a few G-Shock watches prior to this one and couldn't keep the band from breaking.  Never had trouble with this one.  Looking forward to another decade or two without any issues., I like it, Display is not easy to read.  The color of the numbers is too dark compared to the background.  I am returning it., water proof when swimming, Excellent appearance and sale price., fits as expected., Does what i need it to do!, Awesome Deal, Does not keep time well loses up to 40 minutes sometimes for no reason, so cute and fits my wrist perfectly! love it!, This was perfect!, I was just admiring the ProTrek on my wrist which I bought in 1995. It is not exactly the same as the model sold now, but most of the basics are the same. Solar charge battery obviously working 20 years later! Once every 3-4 years, I have had to adjust the time by a minute or two. The thing is indestructible, swims with me, is an old friend. No built-in obsolescence. Thanks, Casio!!!, Like the elastic band, easy to don and doff for my kid. Recommended product., Pleased with item., pretty much every thing you need to repair your own watch and glasses too., My first titanium watch and I am very impressed. The weight makes this watch extremely comfortable on the wrist. The grayish tones both polished and brushed are extremely attractive. This is my first Oris although I just purchased the Aquis with rubber strap which is awesome. Overall the craftsmanship of the Oris seams to be top notch and the accuracy is within range for an automatic of this caliber. Very pleased with look and function of the watch at this time., I love this watch. I work in a fitness related field and am outdoors a ton. This is perfect! It does the necessary functions and is waterproof. Exactly what it said it would be., Awesome, cool watch, Nice watch, decent quality.  Cheap enough that if something happens to it, it really doesn't matter. Buttons are solid.  The display is easy to read., This Watch is incredible! It is in so much higher quality than the pictures and it's cheap as dirt. Even though it's U.S. Polo Ass. (Which kind of has a bad name to it) instead of just Polo, the fonts tiny and no one even notices and it's amazing. It has a beautiful leather strap and a shiny light brown plate behind the clock. It's WORTH YOUR MONEY '', I really like this watch! The case material says, stainless steel in the description, however, it is very light and doesn't feel like steel. If you have a large wrist, the band may be snug. The strap appears to have a leather or simulated lining. I cant tell which. Normally, I buckle the straps to the 5th hole, but in this one, I place it in the 4th one as the 5th is too tight. And my wrists are not large. The face, hands and numbers are easy to read and the watch keeps excellent time. The date numbers are hard to see in subdued lighting and the same is true of the bezel. Having said this, I am still quite happy with the watch and value. One never goes wrong with a SEIKO., Thank you!, It's a great watch. Fits nice, looks nice, lightweight, and accurate. My ONLY problem with the watch is how freaking loud the movement is. I can hear it across the room, I've gone so far to as keep it in another room when I sleep. While worn it can be heard. Another than that The 8184A is a fantastic watch., I like the purple watch very much, my sister like the blue one, so happy!!, Love this watch. I am a physician and have been wearing this watch for the last 15 years. Every time the battery goes out, I get a new one of the same kind. It keeps perfect time, gives me all the information I need like the time, seconds, date, day, month, and more. It is inexpensive and stylish at the same time. I recommend it anytime., I bought this watch on July 17 and today is Aug 26. So now I can't return it. It says its water proof, however, I went swimming in my pool and now it has water drops inside the glass., beautiful, quality watch !, Excellent quality product. Very well built. Keeps time well. My only gripe, it is minor is that is very hard to see the tiny labeling in the bezel ie the inner black dial white numbers. I am 45 years old w average to good eyesight.  Again this complaint is minor!  If however you are maybe 60+ years of age I recommend the Citizen Nighthawk flight watch thst has bigger writing easier to see. Though do note , bigger writing means less functions. This Seiko has way more functionality. So is a trade off, more functions smaller writing or larger writing less function. Quality and sturdiness of this watch is unparalleled. Seiko nailed it right on this one!, I am sorry but this watch is very confusing to set. Even my husband who is a scientist could not get the date to work. Then, when I tried, I got the time but not the date. Plus, to start the clock for a work out it wasn't responding. Perhaps it was us. I returned it because I want something easy., watch was fine but the manual was only in Chinese. I returned it.  The good review you may see was mistakenly given it was actuall for the replacement watch . Similar but not the same . This time with manual in enlish., Excellent, thank you, Bought it for my wife for her birthday - well, actually she picked it out.  She is pleased, the dial is big enough so that it is easily visible but not too &#34;mannish&#34; according to her.  It shipped on time, arrived in good condition,  and we are both pleased.  What more can one say., I did not recieve the way he sin the photo .. I expectates the dial to be gold with diamonds in the picture and they also look like girl watches, Excellent!, Look very closely at the roman numeral four in the picture.  I received a broken watch.  When I contacted the manufacturer they sent me another broken watch.  I still wear it even though it doesn't run.  It is attractive and the band is supple., I have purchased similar bands from a variety of places -- and this one is the flimsiest of them all.  In particular, the center metal strap that goes through the watch band hole is not very strong.  It goes under the metal from that it is supposed to sit upon., Very casual, fit me perfectly., This watch Looks not like it's $75, but more like $750! The gold finished band and the black face go together perfectly for a fantastic contrast that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd. I'd say it's pretty high quality too for being below $100! Good buy I'd recommend it., this is sooo cute I have a really thin wrist so it feels a lil loose..but the color is gorgeous, Exellent, This is the watch I've always wanted.  I may never learn to use all the stuff but it looks cool., We had just received this product a few days ago, and the strap fell off when my son tried to adjust the watch to his hand, Beautiful watch! The color and style is what you would expect from Versace. The price is amazing considering what you would spend in a retail store. My wife absolutely loves it., awesome watch, classic look, makes me feel like a vintage hipster. good quality stuff too for the price. worn every day for 2+ months and leather is still in great shape, I love this little watch!! The band is completely comfortable and the display is clear and easy to read!, My husband loves this watch and wears it daily.It has so many features and is a nice looking watch., I bought 7 watches.They re all nice quality and look same in pic.Thank you so much fast shipment., A very fine example of Invicta engineering.This is a small face for an Invicta but neat and smart., It's a bit smaller than I expected but still a good watch. I have smaller wrists and I have to wear it on the last little hole for it to fit comfortably., Band very small in length would only fit a very very slim wrist.  Wrong description on site, band width is 16mm not 18mm.  I ordered a new band according to the description given on site and when the new band arrived it was too big.  I wasted my money., Loved how the watch fits. Very comfotable but a month after getting it, it quit working., Awesome and unique watch! Please don't let these negative reviews pursued you.. I bought this watch for my 12 year old son who figured out how to set the watch within a few minutes WITHOUT having to go online for the instructions.. On the top corners of the watch there are invisible buttons you use go set to your correct time., Had this watch for a few days ... ITS AWESOME.  Now this is a big watch and heavy too. So keep that in mind when purchasing check out online videos for details, sizing ect .  Worth the value paid !, This is a fantastic watch for the price!, cant set the time, Feels cheap even for a $20 watch. Has bouts of working then not working despite being a month old. Needs constant resetting., This watchband reminds me of horseshoes being tossed, twelve pack boxes of sale beer stood up on one end, and pickup trucks with bench seats that smell of burning oil and gas.<br /><br />I wear it everyday like a boss. It's vintage because it doesn't need to be improved, much like a double-edged razor., Good watch so far. Easy to set/adjust. Display is plenty visible. Not sure why so many people whine about not being able to read it, I got this watch for refing soccer games.  It's fairly shock proof and the readouts are large so I don't necessarily have to have glasses on.  The strap is fabric so sweating isn't a problem.  Decent price.  Good watch., Gorgeous watch with lots of history.  Looks good on the wrist and cannot wait to read up on it.  A legend., Beatifull watch, the product is according with the description, I do not give the 5 stars due to the battery was dead., My husband surprised me with this watch for our anniversary, and I was thrilled!  It's not only elegant and beautiful, it was easy to set, and it keeps great time., This watch was exactly what I hoped it would.  I had silver one and loved it so much I order the gold one.  Was not disappointed., Beautiful watch & speedy delivery!, Very good quality product.. I order 2 model and one for my brother in love., OK product, very light and feels cheap. But considering the figure costs over $3 each at the store, I think it is just OK., This watch band is rubbish, I lost my brand new g shock surfing, don't buy this Chinese watchband, the velcro and strap for watch is not good quality, I am amazed that so many people are saying they like it, must be the Chinese manufacturer giving it high ratings!, Love this watch. Beautiful craftsmanship and details. Came packaged very well with productive tape on watch glass. Not overly heavy but feels substantial. Great because I cannot see up close and the face is perfect with or without my readers. Love the tortoise band. So many compliments o his watch, I am almost afraid to say where it was purchased!, Great watch, offers both military time & regular 12/12 hour day times, and has an alarm.<br /><br />Minus 1 star because i wasn't expecting it to be small, and the light button is decent. But those don't affect the performance of the watch, still a good buy., I bought this watch just a few months ago, and while I think it's a decent buy for the experience/price & value.  What I did not expect was that the ceramic bezel GMT ring just fell off suddenly as I was just casually wearing the watch.  Note:  I wear this watch 1-2 days a week thus very low risk of wear/tear.  I never found the bezel ring and now the watch is pretty much garbage (see photo).  I can't believe it was simply glued on.  Huge disappointment.  Thus, the poor rating I've given to Parnis.  I would not recommend anyone buying a Parnis watch., I loved this item excellent customer service.  It was too big for my son.  He was really sad it didn't come smaller.  Other than that excellent quality.  VERY impressed., excelente, Simple basic watch.  Fairly comfortable.  Numbers easy to read for my old eyes., I initially ordered a watch back in May and it arrived promptly, packaged well, with a nice note explaining the product and how many hours of battery life it has. I was thrilled with it! Since I've used that watch extensively, and since I am not taking the test until October, I decided to order two additional watches should my initial one run out of battery in the interim. They both just arrived--turned on!--and the knob on one of them is broken so I can't turn it off. The packaging was terrible and there was no note about the product or even a packing slip. Needless to say, I am not happy that I'll have to take the time to return the broken product and I'm also not happy that the other watch may have been left turned on for weeks for all I know. Who knows when the battery life on that one will die as a result., This is the biggest watch face I have ever seen. And bought the watch for my son thinking being 'Unisex' it would be on the smaller to medium size. -- WOW!! This thing is ginormous!! Anyhow, not a good choice for mortals., Have owned this watch for about a month now, and can say I've found it to be a really nice dress chronograph for a good value.  Was concerned that at 42 mm it might wear too large on my smallish wrists, but have been happy with the fit.  My only wish is that Orient would have used a sapphire crystal instead of mineral to prevent scratching, but I knew that when I purchased and so far, so good as far as scratches go., Excelent!!, Ok, I love this watch so much, but the watchband is too long for me and I need to go to other place to adjust it., Excelent, Watch is exactly like photo! Super fast shipping!!! Very happy with my purchase!!, Another rugged Invicta.  Built with quality in mind.  Simple watch in that all it has is a second hand and date window in addition to regular analog time keeping.  Great for water use, large good looking watch.  Came with all paper.  Very easy to set., Okay watch, not very satisfied with quality of wristband, This watch didn't work., This watch is more beautiful than the picture shows. I love it and have gotten compliments on it despite only owning it a few days. would definitely recommend it., The watch works but the band is fixed in size and much larger than my wrist., Awesome, I like its simple, classic design, but it seemed low quality.  The date dial was stuck between two dates.  I had to return it because the band was irritating my skin., Fast shipping!<br />It looks awesome! I had so many good complements., A necessary tool for those who change/replace watch batteries.  Well made, the two sizes are great as is the protective cover.  I was finally able to open the back of a watch I haven't been able to for the longest time.  This tool will help you from scratching the back of your watch in the process of opening by lodging firmly into the back edge.  Highly recommend., The Casio Model DQ-750F Digital Alarm Clock is a great product with large clock digits (~1.2 inches/31mm height) and a beautiful blue/green electro-luminescent (EL) backlight.  It has simple controls that are very easy to set the time & alarm without reading the included manual and uses AA x2 batteries.  The alarm beep is loud enough without being too annoying.  I anticipate them to last at least 20 years like my previous Casio alarm clock that I finally had to replace since I wore out the setup switch since I constantly change my wake up time for weekday/weekend.  It is made in China like so many things. My initial delivery of two clocks were both defective with missing LCD segments.  Vendor was prompt to send out two replacement items which seem to be defect free so far. I would buy from Watchtonics via Amazon again.  Thanks to all involved!, Very nice watch.  Well made.  My main use of this watch is time and date. The digital  numbers even see better in the sun.  It's bluetooh. Haah who care. I love it and wear it for the weekend play time., Fine, This watch is HUGE, I thought it was a woman's style that you can wear as a necklace, this is as large a man's pocket watch. But it has held up fine, the case is a little lightweight, but you do get what you pay for., I ran with it, sweat in it, showered in it, and slept with it on for over a month and still looks as good as the day I got it. Expect nothing less from G-Shock., I got one of these 15 years ago.  It runs great and look as good as it did the day it was new.  The watch has a classic look that (in my opinion) never goes out of style.  If you are looking at these, I'm sure you work hard.  Treat yourself to something nice., Keeps excellent time., HARD TO SET, AND VERY BULKY AND STIFF.  VERY VERY LARGE., Good looking watch but loses about 5 minutes over the course of 2 weeks. Constantly having to fix it., Very nice watch, my third and favorite Invicta. Very high quality, keeps time okay, I have to wind and set it everyday., Really like the design, feel and look of my Invicta 80059 pro diver watch, I love this watch! It's a little smaller than expected, but a great buy. The mesh strap is surprisingly comfortable. It looks black in the photo, but it's really more of a dark grey., Needed a classy 17mm band that was short enough for a woman.  Almost impossible to find, so I'm very pleased with the fit and the look., Just got it and - so far - I'm happy!, Simple calculator watch.  These have been in production for over a decade.  I remember I always wanted one when I was in middle school.  It is truly water resistant., The watch band is an exact replacement for original. It is durable comfortable. The band also arrived earlier then expected from supplier., No good, wrist band broke first time I wore it, BULKY... this is a bulky watch with a bunch of fake features.  My 11 year old was not impressed but it has functioned well., Amazing watch. Cheap. But build great. Ive worn it everyday for about a year., Like the size and color, A great inexpensive nice watch to wear to the pool, beach, baseball game, or any place you need to know the time with something that will not fall apart. I bought this watch specifically to wear on vacation wherever I will be around water, and it has not let me down. The band is comfortable, and it really is a sharp looking watch. And you get the Casio quality. The battery is still strong, and it keeps great time. I hope this review has been helpful to you., This is the perfect alarm clock. I bought exactly this one 20 years ago and it finally died. I could not believe my eyes to see that exactly the same model was still available. Hopefully it will still be available in another 20 years when this one dies!, PERFECT!<br />Was exactly what I was looking for and my son absolutely loves it., This watch and look nice but didn't hold up well at all.  First the loops that hold the end of the band broke, then the band itself tore where it's buckled. All within a year., Keeps time but the ticking is VERY LOUD, Simple design, but very elegant and classy. Will go with basically anything! Large and oversized, without looking masculine, which is just what I was looking for., I like it because it is very easy to use and care., Excellent kids watch. Bought this for my 6 year old neice who rarely takes it off. The watch band is durable and the glass watch face has withstood numerous impacts. The watch fits her wrist comfortably and the chrome accents show no wear even after 8 months. Highly recommended., i like it, however it was never mentioned that this watch can not be &#34;sized&#34; by anyone other than a &#34;TAG&#34; distributor.  I think this is rediculousl  I purchased on line because I have no time to &#34;shop&#34; yet now I have to &#34;drive.  Now I have to take 3 hours out of my day to go to closest TAG dealer.  Not happy with that, An excellent smart watch, my only complaint is that you have to make a very obvious &#34;look at my watch&#34; gesture to get the time to display., directves on how to used it, Cute. Definitely for small wrist. It has 2 snaps. I wear it on the first snap. Cheap but keeps time , and looks good!, I'm very pleased with this product. I needed to replace the band on a Casio Men's SGW300HB-3AVCF Multi-Function Sport Watch. It has all the features I need for heading into the back country. This band is perfect for it, it looks as if it will hold up as well as the watch has. I really like the velcro closure. It gives me the perfect fit., The watch hands all caught on each other. The seconds hand moved 4 times faster than it was supposed to and the watch started and stopped (mostly stopped) at random. Very poor quality. Very disappointed. I wasn't expecting a $700 watch quality but for $60 I should be able to expect it to work., Pretty but band hinge broke with not much resistance from my handbag on my arm which was NOT heavy, at all. Must take to a jeweler now to have fixed!, Works perfectly!  I was able to remove the watch backs/battery covers using these 2 tools.  I was not able to remove them before these tools arrived.  Works as advertised &;easy to use.  Feels &#34;good&#34; in my hands, as well.  I'm very glad I purchased these.  Save yourself grief, damage & $$$ & order these tools., kind of long, i had to make my own hole for it to fit on my wrist, but i have pretty skinny wrists so this always happens. Good material, nice and soft but hasnt cracked or torn, Two thumbs way up!, For the price, a very nice watch.  It runs about a minute fast after about 3 months.  Otherwise, I've been very pleased!, Clasp does not clise, Excellent, thank you, It's too big for my wrist and keeps turning.  I will return it., Smart looking casual watch., Beautiful!  Perfect! Looks like an expensive watchband.  It exceeded my expectations., I love the face of this watch very much.  I get compliments often.  I am not a big fan of the band, though many compliment that, too.  I do like that you can adjust it anywhere due to the design.  Its just a bit scratchy on me.  Other than that.  its great!, Clockwork Synergy silicone bands are excellent. Period.<br /><br />Bought two silicone bands for a new watch. The new watch came with a very nice leather band, but leather absorbs sweat - bad consequences follow. Silicone is easy to clean with an alcohol wipe. Not only that, but these bands by Clockwork Synergy are very flexible and comfortable. Additionally, they come with quick-change pins already installed, making it easy to install or remove to give your watch another look.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't love is the shade of green. I would have preferred a darker green or camo (Clockwork Synergy, are you listening?) in the 24mm size band. Well, I knew what I was getting when I ordered it. The other band I bought? Stiff as a board and uncomfortable! Didn't come with pins, much less quick-change pins! This band is excellent and I recommend it with five stars., I like the look and size of the watch.  it is very clear and easy to see the time.  The date is practically  impossible to see - but that doesn't bother me.  My issue is with the bezel.  It sticks when wet. So underwater it is useless.  Clearly for a diver, especially when wanting to rotate the bezel and use it for a safety stop countdown, it is unacceptable., Admittedly, I normally don't wear a watch. Even comfortable watches seem to be an annoyance on the wrist, so I'd carry my watch in my suit pocket... back when I wore suits. Nowadays, I'd check the time on my cell phone... but, of course, in New Mexico you can get out of cell phone range, so... when Vine offered me this Armitron watch I decided to re-visit the days of my youth, when I did wear one.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite pleased. It has a \\\\\"good feel\\\\\" on the wrist, though I note other reviews that complain about the wrist-band. It seems to work fine for me. The main plus is an attractive dial face, with blue background. Since it is an analog dial (and weren't they all, in one's youth), and large enough, it is easy to read the time, even with aging eyes. And that's that... it is a watch, and not an airplane, with lots of features that won't be used.<br /><br />The only drawback that I (can't) see (well) is the date, day of the week feature, which is too small. But a larger feature might detract from its overall attractiveness. So, if you don't reference the date feature much, as I do not, that should not be a drawback. Though it is unlikely anyone would use it as a dive watch (you do need some other features when you do that), it is rated water-proof to 99 ft.<br /><br />Overall, for utility and price, I'd give it 5-stars., A simple and reliable watch. Geat look., Worked and fit. Llike, Excellent, thank you, Best digital watch ever. I am a 40 year old engineer, scuba diver and mountaineering fun. I have Casio's, citizens, Suunto's, Nike's, Timex's and Polar watches but definitely this one has all the features I always wanted in a watch. Solar powered...that's amazing. Fiber carbon strap, 4 alarms, stopwatch start feature with a one button activation....great!!!!!!!! Altimeter, compass...etc. The negative display makes it a different digital watch. If you can afford it...go ahead. My first watch was a Casio 34 years back...and I think this one will be my last. Expensive...but you get what you pay for. Very satisfied !, It appears to have a rotating bevel; it does not.  Larger than I expected.  Nice quality, as expected from Seiko.  Disappointed that the rotating bevel does not rotate (I like to time things easily with a bevel.), Very nice watch! It seems really a rock bracelet so i like it very much!<br />All ok and perfect at the deliver, Already in my invicta watch silicon band, Good watch, buttons are to difficult to press as others have stated. However it is the thinnest G-Shock available at the time so I have decided to live with the button issue., I never had a watch winder but this one is so quiet and works perfectly.  Finally my watch is always on the correct time., this was awful!! to big and looked cheap! DO NOT BUY, Purchased this product for my Son for Christmas. It looked great, but that is were it ended. I paid twice the current $40 price, what a scam these people are... Had problem with the minute hand touching the second hand, so watch does not work because the hands lock up. They want another $28 just to look at it and several weeks to &#34;fix&#34; it.<br /><br />Any watch that can go for a $400 retail price down to $40 is a piece of junk. I will never buy another Invicta product again. EVER! Would have been better off getting a knock-off at Walmart since QUALITY does NOT seem to be part of their owner/customer experience., returned it for better quality, Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery!, Chain broke almost immediately. Decided not to fuss with a return and just bought a new chain. Then clasp inside that holds the door shut wouldn't do its job. Horrible. Heart broken son. Really wanted a pocket watch. Shame!, They instructions are very hard to understand, Update: Im a nurse and I love this watch! I bought it in August of 2015 and it's going strong. It's easy to wash and takes a beating. I'm back for another one in case they ever stop making them. Buy this watch!  I went back and forth before ordering this watch for my nursing job. Ive always used Timex but I thought I might go a different way this time. This watch works, is waterproof and the material looks rugged. I have high hopes. Also, orange makes me happy so I love the color!, I am extremely happy I bout this for my watch. It feels nice and looks very professional but sporty at the same time. I am only upset that after I put it on, the second foldable piece on the bottom does not close all the way, so I find myself continuously reclosing it. Its not too big of a problem, but I wish it was constructed a little better., If you're tall, you might want to think twice before buying this watch. It is VERY small and light -- more like a kid's. I'm 6'3&#34;, and right now I don't know whether I'll keep it or try to resell it to get back some of the money. It's pity, because the design is really cool, and it seems to work all right. I'd be really happy with it, if it were as big as it seems on Amazon., Good looking watch but digital readout hard to read unless your in direct light. analog time hard to read too because it gets lost in the design or color of the background and at night the backlight isn't so great. Scrolling through the menu options not so easy or intuitive., The watch is excellent the only downside is that I have trouble getting the day of the week which is only a minor downside but other then that I enjoy this product, Pretty watch.  Love the colors.  Arrived in good condition and it runs., OEM and the price was right!, love the neon colors. Very comfortable to wear and easy to set up. Simple and easy to operate., the watch was smaller than I thought it would be, but was ok, I get lots of compliments and it was packaged beautifully! Great for summer :) The only thing is that I have small wrists so this watch dances a little on my wrist but I don't mind., Authentically made in Japan.  Nice marriage of orange, yellow, gold and black.  A real eye catcher as production of these watches have stopped so these are now rare finds!, Delivered a day early to my front door. Looks like a $200.00 watch. Works great and keeps perfect time. I never get my watches wet. Just love the look of a Divers watch. Can't go wrong at that price. Stuhrling Original rocks!, I love it and found it for a good price saw another one different a little but cost $150, I've had various makes of Timex Ironman watches in the past, so when my last watch was lost, I chose to replace it with the same brand.<br />Two weeks into wearing it (bought July 17, occurred on July 31), I was river tubing and the &#34;WR 100M&#34; as specified on the face on the watch fogged up. I need this watch for work and it took four days in the sun for the fogged screen to dry. Once it did, the indiglo lit up with nice and then shorted out. The light hasn't worked since. I work night shift as a nurse and need to light up the screen to read the second hand.<br /><br />I now have to get another watch and am wary of this brand., it broke right away, Used this twice the day I got it. First watch I removed a pin to add a link and it was smooth sailing. The second watch had a wider pin that was placed more tightly and while the tool was able to get the pin out about 40% of the way, I had to pull the rest of the pin out with needle nose pliers. Would have been nice if the pin attachment was a little longer. Still, it works great and both watches were adjusted., it's a beautiful watch, but unfortunately I had a bad experience with the carrier, first time my items got sent by i-parcel, and arrived about a week later, it's a big deal to trying to track it down.. Well, good quality and great watch, bad carrier., the packaging is impressive, with the large colored box.the watch comes well protected with a plastic film so that the watch arrives in immaculate state.<br />this watch is very practical, I like the design and attention to detail and the refined features, soft supple rubber is comfortable to the wrist, the rotating dial mechanism feels solid and it has the right amount of friction. the only thing I dont like is that the screw on knob seems very thin when you unscrew it to set the time and start the watch.I feel like I have to turn the know carefully. But once I set the time and date, I screw it back on in place and it sits solidly in place, I have only taken it in the pool so far and no problem, hope to take it into the sea for snorkling before the end of summer, if it fails I will be back. so far it looks and works great., Does exactly what I needed it to do. Holds watches securely without marring the case. I use it whenever I need to change batteries on either mine or my wife's Tag Huer watches., I am returning it because the band is extremely large other than that it was a fine looking watch, cant set the time, This is a beautiful watch but it has a major flaw so I'll discuss the negative first...and this pertains to the brown watch only.  The face is very difficult to read.  If you are buying a watch for functionality, you might want to pass on this watch.  The problem is that there is not enough of a contrast in color.  If you notice how dark the lower part of the watch is in the picture, that illustrates how you must view it at the perfect angle to actually see the details of the watch.  Even under bright lights in the office, you have to angle it perfectly to enjoy its beauty.  Beyond that, it is a great watch.  I have several watches under $100 and this feels like a much much more expensive watch...even for a quartz. The quality, from the packaging to the band to the watch itself, makes this an excellent value.  But for you watch snobs...my statement is based on the &#34;feel&#34; of materials, design and etc.  I'm not an expert on the various movements and crystals to determine the quality of the nuts and bolts of the watch.  Another thing to consider is that it is also pretty large but I happen to like larger watches.  I love the 24mm band that fits the larger face.  If it wasn't so difficult to read the face, I would rate this a 5+.  So will you get compliments if you wear the watch????  That depends on where the person is standing when he/she sees your watch., I liked my watch, Great watch, good for casual wear or more formal wear. I wear it every other day., Is very pretty but it came with no battery..., Love my new watch. I didn't realize that It doesn't have the nicer glass like some of my other Invictas but otherwise this one looks and feel great., Beautiful watch!, Big for small wrists. Loud ticking. Piece that keeps strap in place does not stay in place so strap is floppy., I love this watch! It's very comfortable, even prettier in person. Easily adjustable with removable links. A little on the heavy side but that's not a problem for me., It was just too big for my Pebble Watch. Easy to attach, but even if you tuck it in, it's just too long and bulky at the end, Looks even better in person.  Great size and very sleek.  Though the hands are more than a little hard to read., Always perfect for my lifestyle. don't need reading glasses to see what time it is., This watch is incredible. It is a little larger and heavier than what I am used to. Well made, durable, quality watch. Love the pink face, very feminine., Best watch ever., Broken after two weeks., This watch functions exactly as Soleus describes. The buttons take some getting use to as you select and use the desired modes. Obtaining a satellite signal was not a problem. Syncing to Strava and uploading my run was easy., The dial is large & easy to read, am pleased there is a sweep/second hand. I have always worn a smaller size watch face so am having to get adjusted to the size. The band was stiff & the holes for the buckle very tight. The loop to keep the excess band from getting caught seems to be on the loose side & I feel it may come off ( this is a problem I have & will probably always have )., For an inexpensive watch, it is excellent.  Really stands out and keeps perfect time., very good watch, arrived early, there are hour lines which are hard to see in the pictures. the band is quite nice, Watch looks good and solid build but the band is cheap., the only watch I've ever owned in the past 10 years as both a mechanic and an electrician. never worry about catching something on a wrist watch again and can discretely look at the time while it's on the front of my belt loops., It is even more beautiful in person, i have not given it to my husband yet, its for our anniversary but im sure he will love it, Awesome deal, tOO COMPLICATED TO SET TIME, DATE, ETC TRIED FOR AN HOUR COULDN'T SAT DATE, ETC.<br />I SENT THE UNIT BACK, It does almost all that I wanted it to do.I like the look and believe it will do the job., The watch is amazing and it was delivered on time!, This was the perfect gift for our Grandson's 8 th birthday !<br />Finding it with the Helicopter in the design was the perfect way to keep memory  of the Helicopter ride we gave him for his special day., excelente, The clasp fell off and I haven't been able to return it.  Not really happy about it., Very cheaply made. Would not buy again., The watch only worked for a few hours.  I could not get the touch screen to move, after a few hours.  The size of the watch is nice for a woman.  It was somewhat easy to sync to my smart phone.  I read the other reviews and they help me to figure out which app to load on my phone.  I did receive the order in a timely manner and it was packaged quite well.  Only gave the item two stars because it stopped working, after a few hours of usage., This is a beautiful watch! It can be worn with practically everything!, genial, Bought it for my boyfriend  he loved it but I was pretty disappointed to see it was small. Still a really nice watch though!!, Beautiful watch!!!, Love this simple but stylish watch. Looks adorable in a jeans and t shirt day., Exactly as pictured, received as committed., JUST WHAT I WAS SPEC-TING. THE COLOR IS UNISEX. BIG NUMBERS. IT FIT NICE. THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT. WIN/ WIN. ;)), First time I've owned a Casio watch and I couldn't be happier. Very stylish and after one week of use it seems to keep perfect time. I did have to remove a link from the band but after watching a YouTube video it was very easy., I loved this watch at first, but after 2 months it stopped working!  I am not sure if its a battery issue or what happened, but it was very disappointing!, This watch is more than I expected! I had a Casio Pathfinder for a few years which I loved, inadvertently smashed the face on the corner of a piece of stone.  When I saw this watch I knew it was the next step up and love the features, yet the surprising factor is the details of the watch.  The performance is as expected, been swimming etc...no issues.  Like I said it's the look and details that were the seller for me?, I love the different colors of the bands. Like you have something new each day!, Got this as a gift from my wife. awesome watch! you can even wear this without the larger band but the leather is just plain black., Beautiful watch. Have had many compliments on it., I like the watch. It has a capacity to go under water to 600 feet.  The watch is heavy with a rubber strap band., I LOVE THIS WATCH! The pattern is even cooler when you have it in-hand. There's an orange color in there that comes out more and makes it look pretty cool. Otherwise, it's as pictured on the site. The seller was great. This was an effortless transaction! Thank yoU!, Excellent appearance and sale price., Yes it fits the watch and works, but it is not a true replacement. It is finished on only one side (the original is finished on both), is about half the thickness of the original, and looks &#34;cheaper.&#34; I would say not worth more than $10. Last time my band wore out I shipped it to Skagen repair and they treated it as a free warranty fix. You can now buy original quality replacement from factory, much better., Band was what I expected. Meshed my skinny wrist to a big watch. Inexpensive but quality ok & clasp seems fine., AAAAA, I am pleased with my purchase., Nice clean-looking watch.  Light-weight.  Easy to read screen., I had my eye on this watch around Christmas time of 2014 as I had received a number of Amazon gift cards. A few of the Negative reviews dissuaded me from buying however it remained on my wish list. Low and Behold last week I gave in an purchased a used watch from a wholesaler, for the great price of 19.99, thank God I did not spend a penny more.  The watch arrived promptly and with no delay and is packaged in a  comically large box which if it had not been bent would have looked handsome, all be it huge on my dresser. The watch itself needs a huge box because it is giant! the circumference is so large that it looks like a small wall clock on my wrist. This however is my own fault for not paying closer attention to the measurements. To the watch build itself:<br />1. The watch looks quality from afar, however is extremely cheep. It feels like it is made of plastic and the only actual metal on it is the backing.<br />2. The Crown and dials feel like they might fall off at any minute<br />3. The studs in the leather band are for looks only the band is actually glued and also feel like they might pop right off if I decide to give a random high five<br />4. The &#34;Genuine Leather Band&#34; is already flaking after one day of wear.<br />I could go on and on about how disappointed I am in this watch, however I will simply say, save your money and invest in real watch from an established brand you trust because this one feels like it came out of a gum ball machine., Amazing it's just my expectation, I love the watch<br />  It is easy to read in water aerobics., Good looking watch and is very comfortable. Beware, if you actually use it and and submerge it underwater.....it will fail. Not as durable as I would expect a Columbia product to be., Quite elegant.  Though I plan on getting a real alligator band.  Can't beat the price., I love this watch and have used several of them over the last ten years. The watches have lasted, but not so the wristbands. They wear out and break after a couple of years. The cost to replace them is about the same or more than the price of a new watch. You need to change this!, Very nice watch. Great size. Fits comfortably on your wrist and looks stylish and sophisticated. If you are not accustomed to butterfly clasp watches it may be initially confusing how to adjust but easy enough to soon figure out., This is a pretty good watch. Everything works as it should, and it is simple to operate. The movement is precise and smooth. The downside is the finish is slightly less than what I was expecting and the leather band gets really dirty really easily, and there is no good way to clean it. I've only had it for about a month, but so far I am happy.  Update: strap broke within a month., I'm very happy with this buy!! It's pretty simple to use and set up, even without the manual... I should probably read it though and see if I can adjust the size because it's a bit too big for my wrist(since it's a men's watch). But other than that, I love it! There's even an alarm, like wow haha I didn't expect that at all... AND A TIMER. Talk about a pleasant surprise!, So far the watch is comfortable and looks nice. My only complaint is that the watch is always slow. I need to check the battery in it.<br /><br />Edit 10/02/15<br />The watch is broken will not keep time. I bought a lemon don't be like me., This is very dressy. I can hardly wait to wear it, excelente, They are great little time pieces. I've given my pink face to my daughter. I don't know if I can part with anymore. Casio is a very reliable watch. Plus being affordable for anyone., This watch is superb.  I was in the market for a quality automatic to replace the 30 year old Seiko 5 that I've been wearing forever.  To be honest the old watch with the 7002 movement is still working like a champ but it needs a new crystal.  Turns out I could buy this complete watch for about the cost of repairing the old one.  I was leaning towards a brand under the Swatch group with an ETA movement in the $500 price range until I found this gem.  Pros: Excellent look and layout of the dial.  Everything is simple, easy to read, and looks classy in my opinion. The lume actually WORKS in the dark for a while! Keeps excellent time.  I'm tracking this very closely and I'm at about -1 or -2 seconds a day give or take.  My watch is WELL within COSC standards.  After a two week period I'm running twenty seconds slow. There are Rolex watches that don't keep time as well.  I could possibly adjust to get the accuracy even better but I figure that if it isn't broke I'm not going to fix it until it is. Great fit and finish.  The $185 MSRP is actually a fair price.  The fact that this watch+shipping is less than $60 makes this watch a fantastic value! Easy to set and &#34;hack&#34;.  This is a non hackable movement BUT if you pull the crown and gently apply very light pressure as to make the minute hand almost turn counter clockwise the second hand will stop allowing you to hack with GPS time.  Cons: Band sucks.  That's it.  It's a matter of preference but I prefer a quality leather band over a nylon or canvas weave band.  It's not a comfort or look issue for me, it's a stink issue.  I wear this watch all the time and during a workout sweat goes in, does not come out.  After a week or so it starts to reek enough to make a maggot puke and knock a buzzard off a gut truck.  Easy fix and cheap however the supplied band IS actually nice and well finished.  If you don't mind a weave band the OEM band will work just peachy fine.  UPDATE:  This watch lasted me 4 days shy of a year before it died.  The rotor came loose from the movement.  It may be a quick cheap fix?  I hope so.  I'd like to wear this watch for a lot longer.  I replaced it with a very similar looking, but solar powered, SNE179 &#34;Railroad Approved&#34; piece until I can get it fixed., Excellent if the band doesn't fade., THSIS WATCH IS HARD TO SET AND VERYD LARGE AND BULKY.  I GAVE IT TO MY NURSE, I'm very pleased with the watch and delivery. Thank you., What can I say about this watch? I own many other watches. Some very expensive in the tens of thousands and this SKMEI is simply impressive. It is more practical and useful than most my other watches I own. It looks good too. Might feel cheap if you grab it in your hand but looks great in your wrist. I am taking it with me when i go traveling., Excellent product and fast delivery, it's just as pretty in person. Has a nice weight to it. I really love it!, I bought this watch for my brother's 40th birthday. He is an avid outdoor-kind-of-guy, so I knew camo was the right choice.<br />He loves it! It is sturdy, and very well made. He wears it all the time. The camo pattern is muted, so it works even when dressed up. I may order one for my husband next., The watch is everything I wanted. Nice easy to read large face and very attractive. The only negative is a somewhat stiff band but it looks great, cute watch, little girls first watch, she's nine and loved it.  so far so good., Given its price, I was shocked at the quality of the strap I received. I was hesitant to buy this because of how few reviews were available describing the product. I'm glad I took the chance!<br /><br />The leather is thick and substantial. The feel is smooth and soft to the touch. I was not expecting that at all. Comparing the color of the leather in the photo to what I received. I would say the color is a bit more mixed and lighter in some areas of the leather. The color is somewhere between the underside color in the photo and the top. Regardless the band is still handsome. The mixed color is a sign that the leather is real, because it's skin and there's variation.<br /><br />Keep in mind that because the leather is nice and thick depending on the thickness of watch pins it may be a tight fit. As well as because it is soft it will get marked up eventually adding character to the band.<br /><br />I've bought numerous leather Zulu and NATO straps of varying quality from other brands for a lot more. This is a nice product that slipped under my radar., I gave the gift to my father for his birthday. He told me that he loved it and thanked me. Thank you very much. :), This is a really nice watch with a sleek and stylish design.  I received mine at no charge for the purpose of reviewing.  I receive many items in a similar way which means that I have many many items here, most of which, despite very good reviews, I am not inclined to keep for myself.  This watch is different.  I like it very much, like the styling, like the weight and like the quality.  I wear a smart watch most of the time but if I didn't, I am pretty sure this would be the watch I wear and I plan to keep it for either when I get sick of the smart watch or on those days that I am not in the mood to be wearing a watch that is smarter than I am.<br /><br />I should note that the watch I received has a dark brown face, not pure black like the photo and even the band seems to be dark brown rather than pure black but of this I'm not certain.  I know the product description states that this is a man's watch but these days I think this watch would be perfectly well suited to women who like large watches.  I think it has been classified at being for men by dint of its size alone, but not because there is anything particularly masculine about it.  It is a pleasant face that to my mind could be worn well by either men or women.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out, the instructions are not the best but alas for most of us this is not our first watch so we can probably figure out how to work all of the components.<br /><br />The watch comes nice packaged however the &#34;pillow&#34; that it rests on in its box is covered in some cheap vinyl like material and as a result it REALLY cheapens the look of the watch for me.  If you are giving this as a gift I think that pillow will detract from the value.  This would be much better off with a soft fabric pillow like felt or velvet.  The watch presentation would be far far classier.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I like this watch a great deal.  It can easily be worn by men or women., Beautiful design, my girlfriend loves it. Better than it looks in the pictures., Sorry, it just looks too cheap in person. The printing just doesn't have that extra level of refinement that seems to come across in pictures., One Year after my boyfriend bought this watch and the quality is still amazing, best purchase ever. Five stars for this watch is un underestimation. Best watch ever.. good job, Excellent watch; the band might have been more solid in my opinion.<br />As always, Amazon was just perfect: fast and reliable; thank you very much!, Very nice fit and the tool that comes with it makes removing links a snap, Excellent product! I recommend it, Seems like a good watch, sturdy and easy to read, with luminous hands. Those features, and the alleged 10 year battery, were why I bought it.The jury is still out as to whether the battery will actually last 10 years, which is why I only gave it 4 stars., Cosmetically is very nice and well built but the Chinese mechanical movement inside is pure garbage.  It stops after a period of some time no matter what.  It's the same movement inside watches costing $21 imported from China on Ebay., Love the look, packaging, sturdiness, smallish face, Tritium gas tubes, comfy and neat band, color and design. I am as happy wearing this as my Rolex and other pricey watches. This is definitely sturdier than my Luminox that broke way too fast. I'd like to get same model in all colors, the  watch is  broken, Got a Ferrari watch as a present and I must say I'm disappointed at the quality. The case, dial and mineral crystal is nothing spectacular. The straps are made in China and start cracking after only a few months use. I usually remove the straps off my watches and buy handmade quality leather straps. I took this watch apart and it has Japanese quartz movement that is worth $25-$30 by itself. This is not an Italian made watch, it's cheap Chinese junk with a simple Japanese movement. Don't be misled by the &#34;Ferrari&#34; logo. These watches are made in Asia and carry the flashy Ferrari brand., Awesome watch!  Easy to read and easy to use., Well made and working well. Only the first week., Fantastic face and compliments many wardrobes, from casual to professional. Never need another battery!, This watch has lasted 3 years, and still works great.<br />Slight wear and tear, but I wear it often., 2 month update:<br />Running like a champ, gains 1-2 minutes a week, still delighted!<br /><br />Orig Review:<br />Received in 3 days from LI watch thru Amazon, very delighted with watch, has a real military look + feel to it, one secret in advancing day of week dial is to advance to 4pm then rotate hands backwards to 10am + repeat cycle so it advances a day without having to rotate 2 revolutions/days to advance days, this was on the Orient website video of the Defender, case is 42mm, screw down case back + screw down crown, so I presume this is a more waterproof model much like the divers, Crystal is flat + has a slight rainbow effect when you tilt the crystal so I am guessing it has a non-reflective coating on it, lume works well, Band is very soft + pliable unlike bands on Orient Bambino + Other Lexington models that I have, Dial is Charcoal not Black + gives face a nice Matt Finish + Contrast to the blasted case finish, Too early to judge accuracy, will put it in my watchwinder tonight + wear if for a few weeks to advise accuracy at a future date, so far 5 stars + very pleased!, This watch band is excellent. I changed watch band of my Seiko watch. I payed 150 dollars for my watch. Now it looks like 400 dollar value watch with this band. I love this watch band., worth every penny, I bought this as a gift. I was happy with my purchase, and so was the (young) recipient of the watch., The Watch itself is Huge, otherwise it's OK, does what it's supposed to do. Definitly easy to read., Love this watch!!! I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do! The band has a nice sturdy weight to it and the clasp really snaps shut...so it would be hard for it to pop off and lose it. The pattern on the band is pretty cool too. The face is VERY thin...which makes it even cooler. I like that the band can be two different lengths (not by a lot) by choosing which bar to hook it to. The seller was great, too. This was an effortless transaction. Thank you, I love it!, I thought the face of the watch was bigger than what is actually is, at least from the pictures it appeared to be bigger. I would also like to say that the battery is dead, I need to spend another $15? Now this was not the bargain, so I need to return it!, Received watch without all the parts. Both pins that allow you to connect the band to watch itself was not in package.Thanks for nothing, bought this watch to replace an older one form a different brand that had been beat up by 8-10 years of daily wear.  Was very happy with it for about 4 months, then on vacation we got caught in a downpour and after that it was straight downhill.  Water got under the glass and caused it to fog up whenever I wore it.  Contacted Invicta to have it repaired under warranty and they wanted me to PAY to have it repaired under their warranty.  I proceeded to contact amazon who took the watch back and refunded my purchase price.  I would suggest staying away from invicta as they clearly do not care about their customer, or anything else besides making money., bought the black version for $60. Changed the band but great watch. I just bought this version for $40 on Aug 30th and the price goes up to $692 the next day., Wrong item, Like it very much., Perfect watch<br />Best packing<br />Fast shipping<br />All the best, To me this is the perfect watch..It has time, day of week, and date perfectly displayed and time synced with Fort Collins, No one needs any thing else on their wrist., Smart looking watch, big without being gaudy. No complaint al all., It is what it is. An extremely affordable Quartz watch representing Britain but parts are Japanese or Chinese. Got it on lightning deal for $79 so you can't lose for that price. Surprisingly the leather strap is supple and comfortable in this price range! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the presentation cushion was ripped but not a big deal just a detail, AMAZING QUALITY, It is pretty<br />l gave it for my boyfriend<br />He like it<br />But the box was broken earier i open, What I expected, Excellent watch that looks much more expensive then it is.  Requires very little movement to keep it running and never have to take off to go in pool. Liked it so much I bought another one with a blue face and gold and silver bracelet., I wear this watch almost every day. It is simple and goes with a lot of different things. Looks like watches several times as expensive. I've had it over a year now and it still looks and works like new., I had the same watch years ago and lost it.  This is a standard in the running world., I used to own this watch-though I have no idea what happened to it. It's hardy, timeless design stick in my mind longer than the memories I made whilst wearing it. I still remember clasping my hands behind my head though every time I felt happy and hearing that sweet, lighthearted and reliable little ticking sound from this classic little timepiece. I will order a replacement as soon as I can, I love this watch so much., I ordered this a gift for my brother. For the price and the fact that it's leather, I was expecting something nicer. It's very cheaply made. The stitching is  using thin thread and it's crooked. One of the stitches was skipped which is really noticeable because it's a contrast color. The ribbon for the compartment door is not scored properly and sticks out. I returned this. Definitely not gift worthy and overpriced for what you're getting., Not worth the value paid, I absolutely love it i wear it everyday and the price was literally a steal i couldn't pass up, Beutiful strap. Wish it were just a little longer.......Goes well with a Seiko God case white faced watch!, I love this watch! So comfortable and very stylish, i just wish there was a version in black leather and silver, I purchased this watch as a &#34;treat yourself&#34; after a promotion, so it was not in my usual price range! When it arrived I was excited to see that it was as beautiful as I had expected from Kate Spade; however, it didn't tell the time... obviously a feature I was interested in for a watch! I exchanged it easily through amazon and excitedly awaited my watch again, only to find, upon arrival, that the second watch didn't work either. I thought about taking the watch to a jewelry store for a new battery to see if that helped, but decided that the &#34;included&#34; battery on a $150 watch should work when you buy it! Instead, convinced I couldn't be so unlucky a third time, I exchanged it again. And happily, I received a working watch! However, about a week into wearing it... it stopped working! I am now sadly returning the watch for a full refund (thankfully Amazon's return policy is great).<br />I gave the watch 2 stars because it is a beautiful piece of jewelry... but that's it! If you want your watch to tell the time you should look elsewhere!, i really like this watch, it is my second Invicta watch.If it last like my other Invicta I will be extremely happy, Looks beautiful,very comfortable people ask what cain of watch is it.a get lots of complements, The first watch I ordered did not work, but the second worked perfectly fine., This is a very pretty cock, wish it was a little bigger since it is a wall clock. The second hand is smooth and quiet, it does not tick tock at all, the movement is also smooth., I got this gem for me and my boyfriend's 2 year anniversary! He absolutely loves it! It's not too big either. Shipping came faster than I thought too. I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone., Brilliant watch, very nice looking, i got it as a gift for my sis and she loved it too., Looks like and okay watch., Very nice watch and looks snazzy. I have had mine for more than a year now and still going strong. This is not my daily watch, so you really don't need to move it around much to keep it going., Not the best quality set., Works great, thanks to reviewing what someone else put up showing how you need to align the pin to the extraction point. I had no problem removing the pins on the watch without any bending of the removal pin., After 2 months of using the watch, 01 hand stopped.<br />Today (August 26th, 2015) it has stopped working definitly.<br />Battery is ok., I was looking for a watch with similar styling to the Bell & Ross watches, and this Citizen's watch was the right color with the orange numbers on the dial.  The brown band is also nice, and I'm looking for a plastic orange band.<br />I found a watch called Brooklyn Watch Company that has the B&R watch style but I read that it does not hold up well.  This Citizen's watch is very high quality, and the solar power is a great feature too.  My wife now wears the watch, and she's gotten some compliments on it.  One woman even asked if it was a specially made custom watch since it was so unique., I have an Invicta watch and if you know anything about them - they make a great face.  They then slap on &#34;stylish&#34; or &#34;fashionable&#34; bands.  Please read that as &#34;ugly&#34; and &#34;butt-ugly&#34;.<br /><br />This beautiful brown LEATHER (Oh the smell, the smell!) watch band fixed what they broke.  It made my gold face Invicta look like a million bucks.  If you want your watch straps to be upgraded, don't even hesitate - just hit the buy now button and enjoy.  At this price, it's worth getting the basic black as well, so you can see which you like more, or just to have one as backup...or maybe even so you can switch it out to go with a certain outfit (brown straps with black tie is a no-no in my book).<br /><br />The measurement for these straps is also DEAD ON.  Measure carefully to be *sure* you have something that will take up all the real estate between the mount points for your band - we're talking 1mm off can make an amazing watch look cheap., Clean watch. The band is kinda small but still a quality watch for the price., Could not believe the AMAZING Price, $45, suggested retail over $400! Very elegant, yet durably made.  A little hard to keep untwisted, if putting on one handed...but the beauty is well worth the hassle., We ordered these batteries for a specific flashlight, and it turned out that they are usable in several other appliances around the house. I sure was happy in that we ordered over one hundred of them!, I like the watch but the leather band is patent leather and very shiny - not the smooth matte black leather I was expecting. Just not my style so I'm sending it back., Just one word &#34;Fantastic Buy&#34;<br />Is no Rolex but for daily use is best deal Ever. I paid $59.00  it is worth that 3 X, I had a similar result when I swam with my watch on. The pamphlet claims that you can swim with it, but mine died quickly when it was in the pool. When I contacted Soleus directly, they told me that it is water resistant to 100m, but not water proof.  I asked them what &#34;water resistant to 100m&#34; means, as how could you exert water pressure on the watch if it can't go in the water, and they did not respond.  Likewise, when they admitted that their own documentation shows that swimming is an activity that can be used with this watch, they are still not willing to do anything to support their products.  It is obvious that they are using deceptive practices to try and sell cheap watches.  Please learn from my mistake and follow the advice in the subject line., cool looking. very nice!, Ladies watch, Cheap Chinese Watch, too small, can't believe they advertise it as a unisex watch. Won't return it just because is too expensive to send it back and due to customs requirements. Very disapointed., My first amazon watch purchase. I love this baby. It was inexpensive yet i receive compliments all the time when i wear it. Pity they stopped making the TX brand. Timex should bring it back., Beautiful watch with sweeping second., Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery!, I get compliments on this watch every time I wear it. I really like my watch., I did not receive the pink watch that is displayed, I received a watch with white flowers all the way around the band and I don't think it's very cute like the one in the picture., I love this watch and I get compliments on it daily! Definitely worth the wait!!, Great strap for the money. My second Hirsch strap and I am not disappointed. Not currently in use, but I may switch it back in the rotation again., Cute watch.....the band could be a bit better quality but I am not complaining....., I've had it for a week -- so far so good. It kept perfect time in the first 24-hour period that I had it. This is a really nice watch that's large in diameter but not at all thick., Bought mine at a local Timex Store. Put a black band on it as I did not care for the blue band. This watch is very good if you want a simple, nice looking analog watch. At 42mm it isn't too big or too small. It is easy to read and the indiglo feature is always a nice feature..., Very nice watch. Looks good and feels heavy. The time is accurate and all the functions work., Very nice watch, I purchased this item for my wife & at this time she has two. That's a good thing. Thx, get what you pay for but works fine, UPDATE: See my comments below for starters. Now, with the band less than 3 months old, the short strap broke. It took the original band 18 months to break. I'm lowering the rating further now. Riddle: what good is a watch when its non-standard band breaks every 10 weeks or so? Not much!  This is a nearly perfect replacement for my watch's original band. I would have rated it higher but the original band only lasted about 18 months, and I assume this will be about the same. Also, as on the original, the &#34;ring&#34; that holds the loose end slides easily, so I either wind up with a lot of band extending beyond the ring or with a ring that is floating free without holding the end of the band at all. I just edited the review to lower the rating because the ring I mentioned above broke after a week. That makes the watch really awkward to wear because the end of the band sticks out from your wrist. Fortunately I had the old ring still, and I swapped them this morning., Its a nice durable watch. Took me a little bit to figure out how to adjust the band size.  Have to follow the arrows on the bottom they point to which direction the pins come out.  The face is a little smaller than expected but over all its a nice watch., I purchased/received this watch early April 2015 and by August 15 it had stopped working.<br />I took it to a jeweler thinking it needed a battery (my mistake) and the jeweler also missed the word &#34;solar&#34; printed on the face.<br />She opened the watch back, and upon returning it to me said that it is a solar watch, put it in the sun.<br />now the mother of pearl face is cracked (from jeweler's attempt to open) and per her recommendation, setting it in the sun for 8 hours has not helped.<br />i feel now that I have no recourse with either the seller, Seiko (who has not reposonded to my email), or my local jeweler (since I didn't notice the cracked face until I left the store).<br />I will no longer buy products from Amazon, that cost money more than I'm willing to toss in the trash.<br />grrrrrrrrr!, It is awesome. I really liked it very much. Very good looking😍, You can see the numbers very good.When ever I hit something against it didn't turn how some digital watches do.The time kept changing so I had to reset it every now and than.Its a sturdy watch not too bad.However it died on me like a month later.Not too bad for the price of the watch if you change the batteries somehow., This watch was a nice surprise--very well made and attractive at a price that's a third of the two-tone AK watches I usually get. This is my first Armitron watch and it is quite nice as well as a surprisingly good value.<br /><br />One correction re: other review saying the band is 1/3&#34; wide. It is slightly over 1/2&#34; which is not heavy, but is also not a delicate band. It is about the width of a typical woman's leather wristband. This is probably a good width for the vast majority of users, but if you like a more delicate, narrow band, I think this wouldn't be a good choice.<br /><br />More re: band The alternating two-tone gold/silver pattern is gives a nice textured look, good for casual use and nice for work, but not dressy. To me, although the links are even in gold and silver, I thought it looked a little more on the silver side for the band. The oblong face--again, medium+ size, not big, but not small and delicate either--is classic and modern-looking with its oblong shape, rounded at the corners. The dial doesn't have numbers, but the dots are very easy to read against the goldish/silver-ish face, and there is a second hand which I always like to have (and you can actually see the diamond accent on the dial, unlike many watches that mention &#34;diamond&#34; in their name). I like the slightly beveled edge on the gold around the face because it changes it in the light, sometimes going darker, near-black when you move your wrist in a strong light. Armitron is known for reliability and keeping good time.<br /><br />One word of caution if your wrist is so small that you -always- have to remove links when you buy a watch. This band is adjustable, with one 1/2&#34; link that does come out (and, no, per other review, you don't need to loosen a screw to remove it. You just have to find the right side of the link and pop it open the same way you would if you were opening it to wear it, but the link will slip off if you need the smaller band. If your wrists are -very- very small, though, that one link will not be enough and because of the design of the band, there is nothing more than even a jeweler could remove. So, that would be my only caution, that this is probably not the best choice for those with very small wrists.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a very nice watch that goes well with a variety of activities--and is so waterproof that you can even shower and swim with it! (I was happy about this as I often forget to take off my watch in the shower. With this one there were absolutely no problems!)  :e -very- very small, though, that one link will not be enough and because of the design of the band, there is nothing more than even a jeweler could remove. So, that would be my only caution, that this is probably not the best choice for those with very small wrists.<br /><br />Otherwise, it is a very nice watch that goes well with a variety of activities--and is so waterproof that you can even shower and swim with it! (I was happy about this as I often forget to take off my watch in the shower. With this one there were absolutely no problems!)  :, I'm really enjoying this watch.  I gave up wearing a watch over a year ago but decided I wanted to wear one again.  After 3 months of indecision as to which watch I would choose, I settled on this one and it hasn't disappointed at all., Got the good watch, but bad package, This works for me very well. I was skeptical about this product because I didn't know what type of quality I would be getting. It's very high quality and I've been able to open no less then 8 different watches so far. They've been as big as 52mm and as small as 42mm. I'm a happy camper with this tool in my chest. Replacing batteries just got a lot easier for me. I can do it at home when I want to, and not have to run down to the Jewlery every time. Here's a TIP: Due to the fact that some of my watches have alloy bracelets and I didn't want remove them I sometimes just alighted two of three prongs on the watch and I was able remove the back that way. Furthermore I get a magnifying glass so you can see the battery hold down strap. Thayer very tiny and don't force the batteries out of the watch, you'll end up damaging it beyond repair possibly. It's just easier to do it that way then remove the watch band. In short this is a good product and I would recommend  it to a friend.  It paid for itself the first time that I used it, well worth the money., very pretty, Easy to read<br />Smooth finish doesn't cut my wrist, Slots are too shallow to hold the watches in place. Not adjustable depth, This watch is awesome. I have had it for a few months now and I do not have a single bad review. Still going strong! I love it., Will be purchasing more, well once I have money 😂😭, Excellent watch! Im buying it again,,,, The watch reached before the expected time...it looks gorgeous and it shows way expensive  than its price. . I am glad it bought it., The watch is nice, but the battery died a day after I received it., I love my watch! Mine has a leather band that is quite stiff but that will soften with time. Looks exactly like the photo and I am very happy with it., It does not work., This Watch Was extremely big but too cute. Read the reviews know what I was getting with it being big. However I'm smart and looked up on YouTube how to shorten a watch band. So I fixed it and it's perfect now., I have always loved Casio & this watch didn't disappoint. I love the band which is not plastic & the buttons are set in just enough to not constantly hit them, but out enough to be easy to set things. Alarm is loud...well for a watch. Overall...this is a great watch that I'd recommend over & over., Love this watch! It's tiny, which is just what I wanted. It keeps time perfectly. I haven't had to readjust it once in the 6 months I've had it. It's also waterproof! The only downside is that the band is a little short. For those with bigger wrists it might not fit, but you could always make an extra hole in the band., just the best, very elegant!, OK now...., Like the watch so far. Just getting used to the functions although I probably will not be using some of the features. My only complaint is with the band. not a real fan of this type. It's a little difficult to get the strap in the first loop. I probably will check to see if there are different bands that can be put on this watch. But overall I am happy with the watch., I didn't read in the description that the face was mother-of-pearl, but it is still a very good looking and substantial watch.  Keeping perfect time, so far.  I went to a Kohl's store, where I had bought another watch, and the sales lady was good enough to size it for me.  Great experience in general, from Amazon, to seller, to Kohl's and to wrist!, very nice. would prefer a mm or two smaller, but not to big. looks expensive and though not super heavy still feels like quality. and it's Swiss!, the product has a nic e look and is as advertised., Cool watch for the price. Only issue is no backlight when trying to check the time at night., i use it then for  few months then it broke the stones fell out, As soon as I went to use it, the end piece fell out making it a little frustrating to do any kind of precision work. It got the job done in the end, but would not buy again if any sustained use is intended., stop watch is not precisely pointing at 12 when reset, making me feel like i bought a knock off watch though its now, This watch in the picture is not the item number above. Completely different watch., What a cool looking watch! Couldn't expect better quality for this price. Absolutely love it!, The bracelet loses color and begins to peel. I am very sad with the purchase, Get what you pay for. It works on and off throughout the day. Love the color and fit. Would have given it a 5 star if it worked correctly., Ok, and as described, but overpriced when compared to the exact same boxes available on eBay., to small of a watch, I bought a few of these as gifts for my nephews who are huge Star Wars and LEGO fans, so these couldn't have been more perfect. The links are interchangeable for different color combos, and the characters can be added right to the band. I'm a little worried about durability, they don't seem as solid as most LEGO products, but so far so good., I'm very satisfied w/ the steel bracellet!, Both Watch and band are nice and thin.  Display has big numbers that are easy to read even without glasses/cheaters. Stop watch is full size or seconds on bottom in time display.  I use this watch as a timer for my racing and it is easy to use. No year/month so yes you must reset but is reminds me of the older analog where you had to do the same.  The watch would get 5 stars if it took care of day of month., My second just hope it last 25 years like the last one, 18 mm is the correct width, but the hole for the attachment pin is too far away from the watch.  I have a men's timex ironman triathlon watch., Bought this for my four year old daughter..It looks like a toy, seriously disappointing! and the straps makes it difficult to stay on. A toddler nor an older child will NOT be able to re-strap this watch on their own..I will need to sew some Velcro on the band but not too sure if this is possible. the straps were fraying straight out of the box. Another point, the face is quite small making it difficult for a toddler who is learning to read time. I would not recommend this watch. Poor design. I wish I could have returned this watch., Took about 2 weeks to break in and fit perfectly on watch.  Very comfortable to wear., The strap is very weak anda has no replacement, i bought it to give as a gift for either my husband or my daughter's boyfriend. it is very classy looking, The watch is nice, just smaller in size than what I thought would be(face etc), Very nice watch especially for the money and its  pretty heavy and looks great!!<br />I can NOT hear the second hand tick AT ALL which IMO shows its quality!<br /><br /> The casing seems to be well made and should hold up to being submerged in water, but this is NOT a diving watch (or snorkel one lol)<br /><br />I personally have not used this in or around water (yet) so I can not comment on it in that capacity, but TO ME seems like it would hold up well if you needed to (or wanted to) wear it like at a water park or at the beach or pool (but why do that??)<br /><br />Chronograph works well and has kept perfect time since i set it! The only &#34;draw back&#34; is setting the date every other month because some months end on the 31st and others on the 30th so..... BUT THATS ALL WATCHES more or less that have a date setting.<br /><br />Unless you have Incredible Hulk wrists you are going to have to have links taken out to fit your wrist or you can do it your self with the help of some watch tools and a youtube tutorial though I would have it done by a jeweler or a watch store unless they are charging you half of what the watch costs then I would think about doing it you self. IF you do do it your self you can see the arrows that point in the direction in which the pins should be pushed/hammered out from the inside of the band.<br /><br />Overall I am VERY satisfied with this watches quality and look!, This stylish, elegant and unusual Seiko clock will be impressive in any setting.  The silent sweep second hand is especially appreciated., I like it very useful, The watch keeps accurate time and didn't need any adjustments to the band., It's a very petite small sized watch for being &#34;unisex&#34;.  Other than that, it's classic solid Timex., This is a nice watch for the price. I bought it for my little brother's navy boot camp graduation.  It is not stainless steel as advertised, so I cannot have it engraved, but its a real deal luminox., Military time - check.<br />Not too bulky or too many obnoxious features you will never use - check.<br />NOT the clich&eacute;  pink color just because it's a female watch - check.<br />Sleek design - check.<br />Water resistant - check.<br />Easy to clean - check.<br />Easy to program - check.<br /><br />Nurse approved - check!, Watch band broke two days ago. I expected better quality., Decided to update my review since this the third time I've purchased this watch now I clearly do like it. It's cheap. It works. It's small, much smaller than I thought, but it does the job and has a great price. Now if I could stop losing it (which is why I've bought three, not because it broke)., Only had it for like 2 weeks, not my everyday watch, but no real complaints so far. I have no problems connecting to my iPhone 6 plus, once connected the connection is pretty stable (disconnects every one in a while bit it also automatically reconnects). Water resistance tested against the ocean, still works. As for battery life, tbd at this point, but since I don't use it every day, I may not be the best to judge. The light flowering every review mentions is true and kind of annoying but not a deal breaker. If you can get it at a discount like i did, it's a really good deal., wife loved it but the pins holding it fell out two days after it came in. I thank the one she got probably was just a lemon so I thank ill get her a new one, The strap design is beutiful, and wearing is confortable.<br />A small problem in this clip closure, which opens in some wrist movements., Set the time, worked a few minutes...ten minutes, then stopped....tried to replace battery, very disappointed! Gave to my son to wear....had to give back to me, does not work!!, I just jumped on the g-shock band wagon. The watch is simple and stunning. Was delivered 3 days after I ordered, This ended up being the perfect gift, a quality item with a lovely gift box. My nephew was thrilled., Cheap hardware, especially the buckle,  expected something heavier gauge., This an excellent watch band.  Comfortable and easy to wear......, Very light and accurate watch. Best for the  money., Excellent watch! Bought for an anniversary gift. Very classy design, pleased with purchase. Would recommend this watch, excellent product and price!, Beautiful watch., Nice quality, good looking, strap is kind of thin, it may not last long, My son loves this watch! its a perfect size for his 10 year old hand, its comfortable, its water proof, and the light and watch features are easy to read and understand. So far it's great., Perfect fit. Just like new. Watch a YouTube video for instructions on how to do the replacement, it's harder than you think., I'm overall happy with the watch but was very surprised the hands and hour-markers are not glow in the dark., It's good that Timex is making replacement bands for these Ironman watches, as that was not always the case--when the band broke, you tossed the watch away.  Now I had the band and battery replaced at the same time so hopefully I'm good for another couple of years of workouts., So cool, I own two Klaus Kobec,they are class and very high quality., Quick shipment of watchband, however the leather is quite stiff and will take some time and work to get it to fasten to fit my wrist., Excellent. Will purchase another one or  maybe 2 real soon!, poor quality material, and construction., It's just the right fit., I LIKE, I love it my job requires a watch it's easy to read the minutes don't need a battery<br />Stylish and beautiful., i was expecting a better quality watch, it looks really nice online but once i got the watch it looked really bad and cheap so i end up returning the watch ..., Simple, classic, elegant,  looks amazing with almost everything!, Very nice watch, displays great quality.  Real leather band.  Very small face.  May be difficult to read for some.  Very easy to set the correct time.  All papers included., Nice feels real and for a cheap price, Amazing Watch, love it. I bought this product on 2011 still function and I never replaced the battery.<br /><br />Dude I have a question for you..<br /><br />Do you sell only the watch band?<br /><br />Thanks., Fantastic watch as alwayz...wrist band almost to small....but i have bug wrist and it still fit., I ordered the gold tone watch and instead received a rose gold watch :/, Beautiful and comfortable, I love my watch that was given to me as an anniversary gift. Unfortunately, the face has gotten quite scratched up in only 2 months of wear. However, I'm generally hard on things and so it was somewhat expected, but still disappointing., Ordered a batman watch and received a superman watch. It's for my son that is crazy about batman. Good thing I have time to return before his birthday :/, A charming pocket watch with an artistic design has a rugged build that should last a generation., Think it is a very nice looking watch considering the reasonable price!, Beautiful I bought this for my wife and she adores it and it goes with so much thank you so much., Tried to set time and stem came out---Amazon offers to have repaired under warranty---really---NO--I bought a new item & expect it to work., Nice looking, solid feel., This is a tough watch and looks good.  It came with a decent charge already on it, so all I had to do was set my timezone and it set itself, accurate to the second (I verified with time.gov).  The only issue is that you can't really see the digital displays at night, but you can still tell time with the analog hands.  Overall great product., I will admit the Invicta MSRP are definitely overpriced, and their service leaves much to be desired. However, I have owned Invicta watches for many years (15+) and have always had good luck with all of them. I don't think a 50mm watch is too big for my wrist, I have an 8 inch wrist. The Invicta hater who says he's over 6ft tall must have a much smaller wrist and a small frame. I wear 52 and 54mm Invicta's and they look good on me. So on a positive note, I like the style, the value, the selection, and of course the price of the Invicta's. Mine are all in perfect working order and still going strong after many years., Perfect size :), Mine showed up cracked and with no directions. Do not buy, Although advertised as having an extra long band, no actual measurement is given. As other reviews reported, the band is not noticeably different from any standard watchband. I find it uncomfortable  to wear for more than short periods  of time.<br />So far as function is concerned ,  the watch loses a minute or two each day, and the calendar also needs to be reset every couple days.<br />The watch looks good, but doesn't do the job I bought it for. If the packaging hadn't been thrown out, I would return the watch., Extremely large, swallowed my little wrist. Looks more like a man's watch on the wrist. Love th fact that it's multi-functional, just too bulky., Slightly larger than I expected but very nice travel box, Lovely watch, perfect size...not too large on a small-boned wrist, but not too small, either. Had no problem setting the date and time as others have indicated, but if you really need the date this isn't the watch for you--it is extremely difficult to see/read. Also, the second hand looks just like the other hands, so when taking a quick look it is easy to misread the time. That said, it is a beautiful and comfortable watch, with unlimited band adjustment that is easy to do yourself., Very high quality. The fit and finish are top notch. Not having the word SEIKO on the clasp is not a concern of mine. I recommend this for anyone looking a watch band replacement., glass on watch was broke and hand to pay out of pocket,$10.80.cent send it back., This is currently my husband’s favorite watch. I think he liked it immediately thanks to its somewhat understated look.  It actually looks much better in person though the body is a little thicker than he is used to. The glass doesn’t bulge too much though, so there isn’t much distortion when you look at the time. The body and strap are a brushed black metal with the faintest, barely noticeable aged-bronzing on the edges of the strap.  The strap is easy to remove thanks to its pinch-type latch where you squeeze the edges at each side to release. When closed, the latch is not that obvious and blends in with the rest quite well. There are some chrome details. The outer Tachymeter bezel is chrome, as is the bottom half of an inner bezel.<br /><br />The main face has two chrome hands while a small upper left dial counts 30 minutes, small upper right dial the seconds in a minute. A lower center dial displays the day with a date window between the day and 4 o’clock position.<br /><br />There are 12 fairly large and well defined hour markers with luminous accents similar to the ends of the hands. The luminescence is quite weak which is ok; this watch tries to be understated rather than draw attention to itself though I can’t say it has entirely succeeded.  On a ring around the 12 hour markers you have 24 hours printed.  And a ring around that has various popular cities around the world listed for setting time zones.<br /><br />The time zones are set with the single left hand winder. Unfortunately for me at least, the text is too tiny for the timezones to be very useful without a magnifying glass. The time-zone winder rotates the entire ring around inside the watch probably so you can offset it for easy reading.<br /><br />On the right hand side there are three controls. The upper button starts and stops the stopwatch while the lower one resets to 0. The reset is not instantaneous as the second hand smoothly completes its 360 degree rotation back to 12. The stopwatch second hand is for the stopwatch only despite being a thin hand that is viewed in the main face. As previously mentioned, the second hand that runs all the time is in the small right hand face.<br /><br />The main dial for setting the time comes extended with a collar that you have to remove to activate the watch. The collar is too fiddly to do by hand but a pair of tweezers or needle nose pliers can remove it with the gentlest squeeze. Then you can set your time, day and date easily enough. When set you need to screw it down to its locked position which will prevent tampering and seal the watch from the environment. The watch is water resistant up to 330 feet, but only when the winder is screwed to the locked position.<br /><br />The watch has a five-year warranty which is void if the adjustment knob isn’t screwed down to its locked position.<br /><br />The watch looks much better on his arm than on its own. Despite being more of an understated design I have noticed a couple of cashiers at local stores gawk at it which was a bit odd. It’s a nice timepiece that he always wears when we go out. He tells me that part of the reason he does so is that it’s much nicer and more polite to be able to glance at a watch discreetly while driving or sitting at a table than digging a bulky phone out of a necessarily deep pocket somewhere on your person and can make for a nice fashion accessory.<br /><br />I really like it.tch second hand is for the stopwatch only despite being a thin hand that is viewed in the main face.

I bought this watch for my wife to use it everyday when she is with our daughter. On the beach too not in deep water. After 2 times was this watchin the water it was failed and not working.<br />Nice watch but not in the water. 😟, Excellent product, fast shipping.  Buy without hesitation., Very nice looking watch, good weight and thickness.  Band is quality even if not real leather, not cheap.  Makes for a great casual or dressy watch.  I really like the blue face., Instructions are useless. No matter what we did could never get the time to set. We are sending this back. Disappointed because it looks like a nice watch., I had looked for quite a while for a watch that was elegant looking but I didnt want to spend a lot of money on it.<br /><br />This watch caught my attention and upon further reading seemed like what I was looking for.  I was also glad it was an Elgin (my last Elgin went through the washer and dryer and still worked).<br /><br /> I was very pleased with this watch when I received it.  It is even much prettier in person., I spent sometime looking around at some nice display cases and I settled on this one because it has so many slots to accommodate my growing watch collection for the next few years. I didn't think it would be so massive, but I can deal with it as it displays my watches very well. I am also happy that it accommodates all of my big face watches, to include my Diesels. I was extremely disappointed in the build of the watch pillow cushions, especially for the price that I paid for the display case. The watch pillow cushions feel like they have some low quality cotton and sides made of cheap cardboard, all bound together by some cheap black material. I honestly may invest in purchasing some quality watch pillow cushions to match the overall décor of the display case. Once again, this is a great product that will fit watches of all sizes, and allows one to display their favorite timepieces., I really liked it, hopefully my dad will too., Detective item, I love this watch.  My husband bought it for me for the summer since we do a lot of swimming.  It has been in swimming pools, lakes, and the ocean with no issue whatsoever.  The band dries really quickly so it doesn't feel uncomfortable and I've even showered with it on and done dishes just to keep the band clean.  The face illumination is great, too., The watch works fine but the adjustments for day and date are finicky, hit and miss., For $17 can't be beat.  Took a week or two to dial in the tides.  Works good now.  Need to be a geek to get it programmed right and understand tidal intervals(thanks google).  Face scratches easily, but again it's $17., Love it! I got rid of the green band and swapped it with the &#34;Mokingtop 18mm Waterproof Silicone Rubber Watch Band Deployment Buckle&#34;. The band fit perfectly and the watch looks completely different now. Quite a bit more sophisticated. The watch is top notch, not some cheap knock off. Keeps time accurately and the second hand is right on the mark. I am completely satisfied with this purchase!, exelente, The finish on this is very nice, however, it is quite thick and bulky once it's on the strap and makes it a little cumbersome on the wrist (I guess it's designed that way so that it fits watch bands of all thicknesses., Excellent, Nice-looking watch. Comfortable to wear as the leather band/strap flexes with ease. A arrived right in time via Amazon Prime., This was a lot more BLING than shown in the picture., This watch began to lose time after about 4 months of use. There was no damage to the watch and the lost time kept getting increasingly worse. As of now, it loses about 20 minutes per day and has to be reset several times. I am in the process now of trying to get the device exchanged or repaired and will update review later with my findings., Awesome, Surprised and pleased with this purchase.[[ASIN:B00ZOEJ9QI Mudder Watch Band Link Remover Pin Tool Kit 5pcs]].  I used it to remove a link from my new watch. The caveat for me was to TAKE MY TIME WITH IT!  It gets a minus one star because the instructions were for another product (the picture and the instructions look like they should go with a product like the Leegoal Watch Link Remover with Pins)., I did A LOT of looking around when my old watch died (Fossil) and I was drawn to the Seiko 5 line. The automatic movement appealed to me, and the crystal back plate is a nice touch as well. I bought this watch as my everyday work watch. I am a manufacturing engineer and go from working in the machine shop, to business meetings in the same day. This watch wears well and has great eye appeal to match my needs. It matches my business casual look very well. I love the black face and white hands. The red second hand tops off the look in my opinion. I like this watch so much, I will be adding more of the Seiko 5 series in the future., Don't buy it. Within two months its strap ripped apart. I barely wore the watch. UNBELIEVABLE., Looks nice for the price but give it a close look and you can tell it's a cheap watch., I like this product look so cute, I should have researched the sizes and things better. I do not have any larger than average wrists, and I was on next to last hole on band. This maybe should be listed as women's or child's watch. Looks nice though. Is very thin and lightweight. Just very small., Heavy watch, but I love it. Very pretty. I wouldn't call it grey, though. Doesn't match any of the greys I have in my wardrobe. It matches a couple putty colored items throughout my house. I still like the watch, but I purchased it to wear with all the grey outfits I have.  UPDATE:  I've grown to really love this watch. It has helped that every time I wear it, someone compliments me on it. I finally took it to have links removed because it's so big. My wrists are thick, but even I had to have two removed. To wear it like I should, I should have two more removed. But I like to wear my watches big. It still is not quite grey. But it's a unique color and one you'll never see in another watch., I really like this watch. The band is not a dark brown but I do like the color brown that is on it. Thanks Amazon!, It's very nice I love it so much.<br />I recommend this bracelet from this store.<br />Sure I will buy more.<br />Thanks for you my friend., This is a awesome time piece!, Nice time piece for the price. Invicta is always good quality! ., I love this watch. I have a larger automatic watch that is just too heavy to wear all day at work. This watch is smaller, lighter and just what I was looking for in a ladies' work watch. Because it is automatic, I did not mind that it was a later model as I did not need to worry about a new watch with an old battery. Excellent price!!, Great starter auto. Keeps reasonably accurate time. Small on the wrist, but works well with smaller wrists. Feels solid. I really enjoy this watch., It is nice looking, and easy to read.  I am very pleased with this watch., Everything I hoped for in a beginner's watch for my 6 year old nephew. Looks to be well made and my nephew loves it! Hoping it has the lasting power needed for a watch being worn daily by a first grader!, the band is pretty small, more like a child's band, Great watch I'd buy it again as I have, but a bigger face to read the date and the numbers would even better. It has an indiglow which makes seeing time in the dark worth it big time., Can you say AMAZING? Moto has a real winner with the 360. Kudos Motorola, Kudos. And thanks Amazon for putting the 360 in your warehouse deals. The pricing is just unbelievable., i was very happy with it until just recently. bought in december 2014 and it was exactly what i wanted. then in july or august 2015 there were a couple of instances where the winding stem got pulled out inadvertently, which of course stops the watch. the 2nd time it got caught on some clothing and i realized it right away. that really shouldn't be happening so the stem is coming out more easily than it should., It was an excellent gift for my Wife, very nice watch haven't figured out why this watch is worth 1500.00. I'm glad I got this watch on sale, Locking clasp caught on Khaki pocket, broke after 36 days. Unfortunately Amazon only covers a 30 day warranty/return policy whereas Nixon covers a 3 year warranty so that's a $55 repair plus shipping; A waste of time and money, Job well done, Its just what i expected. And it keeps time, very well. I just wish you would make the elastic bands a little bit larger, for people with fat fingers ( like me). ☺, I bought this specifically to use on a canoe trip knowing it would get wet. It's simple yet very functional. I went swimming with it, dunked it in mud, and perspired heavily on it yet it kept going.  For me, it's the perfect outdoor watch. One thing to note is the description stated the band was nylon. It is actually rubber or plastic with a nylon outer layer.  Very function able and affordable., Love the look and weigh but a little hard to set date(could be I'm a little slow 😏), Bought this for my girlfriend (her choice) for a birthday present. She's worn it 2 times for a total of about 6 hours and went to put it on this morning and one of the mesh links had snapped in half and the other one on the same side was starting to stretch. The watch is a bit loose on her, even with removing a link on the band, so it shouldn't be stretching. Definitely not even worth the current price, let alone over $400., I love the look of this clock and the sound.  Mine has a variety of songs: a Disney song, a Beetles and The Titanic theme song, which my birds have dubbed their favorite.  If you have birds of any kind, they will look forward to every hour.  It's done it's job in our house--it cheers us all up. It keeps time perfectly.  I love how the light sensor prevents it from going off at night, and the fact we can switch to Christmas songs in December, though  I keep forgetting to do it.  I'll write it on the calendar!  About once every couple years, it starts to sound muffled, and that's when I realize it's time to change the battery.  I can't help but think that is the reason so many reviewers think the sound isn't good. Batteries should be brand new, and then last a long time.  But if they are low at all, it won't sound half as good.  The only problem I had was the pendulum stopped swinging when I moved it. I can make it move, but it stops. I'm not sure if it's a problem with it not being level, battery connection or just that the pendulum is no longer in the correct place.  I don't even care, I like it so much.  Guests look at it and compliment it, not even realizing it should be swinging.  I'm having a clock doctor come for my coo-coo and grandmother, so I'll have him take a look.  He thinks it's the battery.  I'll try to remember to update you on what the problem turned out to be.  If I don't have the answer in a week, message here, and I'll let you know., Very nice, clean looks.  Bought it for my son, liked it enough to buy my own., This is my 2nd G- Shock and certainly won't be my last. You just can't beat these watches for their toughness and versatility. And the price for all this watch does is a steal. This watch is amazing and looks even better in person and it took about 2 minutes to set up. Great deal., It broke on the first day I got it. Band fell apart., Arrived so quickly! Beautiful watch, Beautiful, look elegant . im sure i got a good deal!, 1 star cause i cannot choose none. Just 1 month user., Nice slim black sports watch. Holding up great so far! I wear it every day and it works with most of my outfits (not overly sporty)., very happy with it., Simply awesome, I really like this watch,  It does all I expected it to do. and very comfortable to wear., Love it very compfortable.  I bought  it at Walmart  3 days ago for $30. It's got large numbers and I like the size. I own 7 gshocks  l just hope this  one holds up. But for the price  you can't  beat  it., Surprisingly high quality for the price. I get compliments on it every single day. I've already linked several other friends so they can but it as well. The thin band lends it a feminine feel and the neutral grey allows me to pair it with everything., It was broken, Fair quality.  Looks a little cheap. I should have gone with the silver instead due to the black come clashing with the black band., Really love the color. Haven't seen gray in any store. I just wish the band was a little wider., Excellent watch!, thanks, One problem I had with it was that the stem came out completely when I was setting the time.  I put it back in and it seems to be fine.  I had purchased a Timex earlier in the year and the stem broke off one day when I was  mowing the yard.  This could be a weakness in the design., Excellent watch!, Perfect for the tweenaged kid, Received the watch band and the metal adjustable piece that clicks into the watch face was broken.<br />Was traveling when the package was received, so now unable to return the defective product., Just what I needed and not anything more.  Perfect., The pink band is vibrant and beautiful, the rhinestones with gold tone is absolutely gorgeous I love it., the wristband is not leather, Very cheaply made watch., [[ASIN:B00N2BIFXS Michael Kors Men's MK8362 Gage Analog Display Analog Quartz Brown Watch]]<br /><br />Come on!! This watch is wonderful. Awesome delivered to. That's why I put 5 stars, This will be a Christmas gift.  I start early.  Hope the warranty is from Christmas. Hope I don't<br />have to use it at all., Quality watch. Quite handsome., Great watch. Easy to read and the watch looks nice. It is not a dainty small watch but a nice watch for an active person who wants an everyday watch. Just a side note two weeks after I had it they battery  died.  Returned the watch received a second one . Same issue had to replace the battery. Decided just to do that instead of exchange it , because liked the design of the watch., the battery it came with was almost dead. You can't replace it yourself, but take it to any watch store/kiosk and they can replace it for you., This is the cheapest piece of garbage I have ever seen getting passed off as a watch.  It is way, way too large as well.  I could wear it as a belt.  It's an awful piece of trash., This is a beautiful ceramic watch that I wanted. The quality of the watch is better than I expected. The shipment came on time. Others were all complimenting it a lot!, Amazing watch. Only complaint is that the second timing dial does not match with the outer marks., It's awesome! I have a buddy that has a real g shock and he was so surprised when he found out I only paid 17 bucks for it. It's also seems to be very well maid. I've only had it about a week, so if it falls apart or the company doesn't hold up to the two year warranty I'll definitely change my rating., I love it! It is perfect! the quality and the model!, I got this watch through another website on an overstock sale.  I jumped at the price (slightly more than $30) and while the watch looks fine, the watchband bracelet feels cheap, and the overall feeling of the watch is that it isn't as good as an Invicta or something directly above it in price class, like a Bulova.  While the tiny dials on the face make for a nice complement, don't fool yourself into thinking they are readable or give you any information.<br /><br />In addition, mine arrived with a dead battery.  The retailer did reimburse me the cost of getting a new one.<br /><br />It's an okay watch, but the feel on my wrist reminds me there was a reason I got it at such a deep discount., So Classy!, super cool i like it, what a disappointment! after just one week of normal wear and once to the beach, I come to find out that the glass scratches so easy. Other than that the watch was great! too bad it doesn't take normal wear and tear very well., Love the look of the watch but was very disappointed that the date, day of week & 24hr dial are just for looks & do not work. That's one reason I purchased this watch., its a nice watch.  flashy.  but i couldnt get the stem out to set it without a pair of pliers.  small dials are so tiny as to be unreadable without a magnifying lens.  maybe worth the discounted price i paid (about $90) but no more., this is so classy. Its a mans watch but I am keeping for myself. the band and face are gorgeous . shipped in a beautiful box and very quickly., Returned the watch due to small size. I have a small wrist so I honestly feel that advertizing this beautiful piece as Unisex is misleading. After returning I purchased the same version at 43mm. I rate the watch with 3 stars just because of the size. Otherwise a very nice watch for the price., works like the original.  couple of suggestions.  take a pix to remember which connection is for the short and for the long strap.<br /><br />look at a youtube video for the paw1100.  same technique as for the 1300.<br /><br />it is simple.  hold the watch case in one hand.  use a small slotted screw driver to pop off one of the clips.  then use a needle nose pliers to<br />pull out the pins. i used a nail like punch to push in the pins (just a small amount).  this made it easier to pry off the clip (the clip says PATHFINDER OR  MULTIBANDS., Amazing, Looks even better in person. Watch face is large and exactly how I like it. Very easy to set up. Comfortable on wrist, Beautiful watch and I get alot of complements on it., Better then I expected!, Very pretty, easy to  read the face., As advertised, Crap. You get what you pay for :), It's a key chain that come apart not much to say., Doesn't read an accurate time and came with dead batteries., Wearing it every day, Beautiful watch!, Best watch ever!, I really like the watch .I just have one problem. I've only had it for a little under a week and it's already losing timme., Fantastic watch! Vintage look, beautiful timepiece. Only have to make sure it stays that way now!, This is a perfect replacement for the Timex that I finally had to retire., I like it so bad it fits perfect what a nice watch!!, When I receive this order I cant believe its so nice And exquisite beauty I Will recomend this To My Best friends., the only issue is that it is a bit snug on my wrist, however I am in the process of losing weight so it should fit better once I reach my weight loss goal., I returned it.  At too many angles it was difficult to read.  The watch readings faded to where they virtually disappeared.  I bought the watch as a replacement for for the same model that I purchased 15 years earlier and am delighted with., The watch arrived much earlier than initial deadline , which was perfect for me. It has a tight fit ( I am roundy but have small wrists) , it is not uncomfy just a very precise fitting, but I had a similar watch once and with time it did become a bit more lose. I really like the details and the stones , so far I am very content with it!, Cute watch, very versatile. Like someone else wrote the leather is stiff at first but breaks in very quickly. I have a pretty small wrist and it fits comfortably., This is a great watch. Have had it for about a month now. Very intuitive to use the various functions and has stood up to some pretty indifferent treatment. It has got to be one of the best under $20 watches out there., nice and cheap,<br />the glass/plastic on the face is very soft and easy to scratch, Excelent, Love this beautiful watch! I had to remove 4 links but it was easy to do once I watched a how to on YouTube. Now it fits perfectly.I have a small wrist and the diameter isn't too large for me., cute, Works fine with the specified watch model (Seiko Diver SKX007). Looks and feels great. Glad I got it although the price feels a little too high, like twice what I would want to pay for the band., Swam in the Gulf of Mexico with it. I love it. Better than the Swiss Army Watch I bought that gets moisture under the crystal after being rinsed off., This watch band came with a small cut in the leather showing the brown underneath.  Because I needed a band, I kept it and used it.  2 months later it's cracked, and marred in several places.  I need to replace it because it really looks bad.  The price was low but so was the quality.  It's a shame because it's really attractive if it wasn't all cracked with the white coming off., Really disappointed in this case opener.  I find the &#34;knife blade&#34; style openers work better than this and are cheapter.  I tended to scratch the watch back case trying to get this to get it to lift up., I like the product I will buy again, SUPER TIGHT LOOKING WATCH,BIG,HEAVY,WEARS WELL,AN ALL THE COLORS &#34;POP&#34;, Certainly a 5 star watch for the quality you receive for such a minimal price. This watch is the ultimate in comfort and convenience. Easy to set, clear to read, and perfect for nearly any occasion. Very Pleased with my purchase., Watch was broken and luminox wouldn't help. Amazon.com gave money back., Large numbers ae easy to read.....simple swithcing to chrono and back., Bezel is in a fixed position. It does not rotate therefore tachymeter function is useless. Numbers are hard to read on the chronograph dials. One of the worse Invicta watches I own. Should have suspected something when the last one I ordered was disappointing. iI just got it today, and it's goingback to Amazon tomorrow., It's good, a bit heavy maybe. I like the look and the multitude of functions. Is as described and for 20 bucks you can't go wrong., Awesome.....love it....great product especially how it lights up & has a sturdy band., it was a good watch, I like the color and its very beautiful. but only thing I don't like is I feel like its not very durable., Fantastically comfortable, versatile and stylish watch.  Very high quality and a steal for the amazon price., My favorite watch due to the count-down feature; just needs a backlight to get 5 stars., I like it,beautiful, I love this watch, the details are so cute. BUT IT BROKE IN TWO DAYS!!! I'm a Dental Assistant and I needed a watch for work so I decided to go the extra mile and pay the extra money for this one and I am very disappointed with this watch., as expected for the price, Great value.  I really like the classic and clear face on these Seiko dive watches.  Nice to know I can wear it ANYWHERE without a worry.  I also own an orange monster and that thing is a tank.  200m is more than enough depth rating.  Most recreational divers don't go anywhere below 50m., I would have given this 5 stars except for the clasp on the band which requires a click on each side of the watch band.  Otherwise, the watch works well and looks nice.  I have only had it for a week so I cannot comment on how long this one will last.  Note that I love the outdoors and am tough on my watches., cheap, oversize face. No second hand., One of my favs, excellent., Very nice looking. Had to take off a few links, really big....lot s of compliments..., Love this watch. It is the perfect size and style for me. It is now my everyday watch., Watch came with original box price tag and little booklet ... All Original Love it !!!!, Perfect !!, Purchased as a gift.  It is a beautiful watch.  Very pleased with this purchase., I can honestly say the pictures do not do this watch justice.  You would be hard pressed to find a better automatic watch under $200 that is as good as this.  You wont be disappointed., Plating started coming off within 3 days and watch band broke within 10 days. You get what you pay for., Took a while to arrive, but I do love it! Very cute and comfy. 4 stars just because it took a few weeks to arrive. But it was worth the wait., It has a light-weight feel on my arm, and I am impressed with the boat-load of features this watch includes. It definitely requires at least a casual browsing of the included manual to get things setup, but the instructions work well., Love this watch... Even more beautiful than expected...arrived in two days with my Prime., very classy watch and beautiful color combination. I am giving it as a gift and I know it will be a hit . beautifully boxed and quick shipping, It's not my most expensive watch but it's my coolest looking one by far. I LOVE IT!  The size? It's a man's watch, what do you expect?, Nice watch. This is my second Seiko, the other being an automatic SRP275K1. I was looking for a &#34;filieger&#34; pilot-inspired design  and this watch got me at the orange highlighted main markers and hands. The watch is a quartz chrono which looks as depicted, no disappointments. Solid Seiko build both in the case and band. The watchface is nicely detailed with the succession of outer and recessed inner rings adding a nice depth. The orange highlighted hands lends a very good visibility/readability to the time in what could be construed as a &#34;busy&#34; watchface as is the case for most chronographs. The outer ring markers as well as the hands are lumed with bright and lasting seiko lume. The top subdial, triggered by triggering the chronograph is for accruing laps by the minute up to 1 hour, while the bottom sundial keeps on ticking the seconds providing a second-hand during chronograph use.<br />The band is well built, easy to resize by removing links (arrows on the underside indicate the direction to remove pins easily by pushing with a small screwdriver/nail/paperclip) and I appreciate the double locking mechanism. I personally successfully tried swapping out the band for a nato strap (not provided) which is easy, provided you hold the lug-cover part of the band firmly in place while compressing the springbar.<br />Both case and band have a brushed front finish and shiny side finish which provides nice detailing.<br />The only drawbacks for me are : 1) the size, it is a rather large watch for my slender first albeit well-balanced with the band so it looks big but not ridiculously oversized, so be warned 2) a very minor drawback is the small date window at the bottom of the bottom subdial which is not very readable and therefore not very useful...it could have been omitted.<br />Altogether a good solid buy with no regrets., Like it... it's really cool...., I received my watch very fast and it was beautiful and authenic. I would love to shop again with this buyer.  It hard to find authenic name brand items and the price was awesome. Thank You!!!, Got this so I could travel without worry about losing a watch. It is cute and easy to see. However, the settings are hard to manage and the buttons take strong fingers to hold and switch. I had to have my husband set the watch as I was unable to do it., Looks cheap but otherwise works as advertised, great watch for the price.. water resistant and really nice looking, This is a all made rubber watch band.  It was a replacement for my Pulsar dive watch. IT matched almost exactly. Could not be happier with my band.<br />My only issue really, is that the strap is too long and tends to stick up if you don’t put the slider bar near the end.  Would buy again though., This Topwell watch is very unique and different. The watch is made of red sandalwood and white Canadian maple wood and honestly I have never seen a watch quite like this one. I also love the fact that it is Eco-friendly with an earthy feel and look to it. It's waterproof, works just like any other analogue watch and very light-weight. The colors of this watch is beautiful and it fits comfortably on my arm without having to do any adjustments. The watch is adjustable if needed so that is a very good thing. This is a great gift for any women in your life. The craftsmanship of this watch is amazing and your sure to get many compliments when wearing it.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review and opinion., I received this today, and will be returning it tomorrow. The dial color is not at all what was pictured on the website. It is a much darker shade of blue, which almost looks black under non-sunlight conditions. The main reason I purchased this watch was for the looks, and for the color of the blue dial specifically. Pretty disappointed.<br /><br />I can't comment on the functionality, reliability, or robustness of the watch as I did not use it.<br />I hope this review helps others who are interested in the watch because of the dial face color., The watch is attractive, but the day is in Spanish. Haven't yet figured out how to program it to English. No instructions included., Excellent!, i used to purchase a pro-trek and then this watch changed my mind. i know the resistance of the g-shocks and this is the first three sensored g-shock. i bought it through a local dealer. i am really happy to see that the sensors works correct and the datas are accurate. my only complain is the resin band. it really hurts my wrist. the back of the metal buckle on it is unconfortable., It broke after a short time., My wife bought this watch and really likes it. No more batteries to buy! The so called watch band is cheap and so stiff it is hardly bendable to get around her wrist.We are purchasing a genuine leather band. Only four stars because of the band., The watch is super simple and slightly feminine. I need it for nursing school for the third (&#34;sweeping&#34;) hand and find the watch to work out nicely since it is a fair price, has 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime Student, and looks nice on the wrist, if I may say so. However, I do not believe that this watch is waterproof and so I would advise (future) users to be cautious around water.<br />To set the time, all you have to do, which can be slightly difficult, is pull out the tiny knob on the side and keep twisting and twisting it until it reads the correct time. Afterwards, you just push it back in., #1 selling watch in the world , still have one and it is about to surpass 5 yrs with same battery,, The watch is very light and comfortable so I am very pleased. It is also very easy to read the digital display., It's awesome 🙆, I like best the double-ended tool: it feels stronger and sturdier than cheaper-priced versions. Was able to replace mesh band for my Asus Zenwatch quite easily. Haven't had occasion to use the pins nor the detachable ends, but pleased with overall purchase., The second hand doses not work...... other then that it works and looks beautiful, Me gusto mucho, Muy bien, It is a typical Casio watch.  Within three weeks of ownership the watch band broke off one of the pegholders.  It's happened to every Casio I owned, but it's been a while and I hoped they had fixed the problem.  Obviously they didn't.  On the bright side, when I could still wear it, it gave me options I didn't have before.  But the info guide gives vague directions, like it could help find my Iphone but didn't tell you how.  If they could ever fix the watchband problem it would be a good buy.  Luckily it only cost me $30 or so and not the suggested price.  Do not buy if you actually plan to wear it., Great Quality watch. I did have to have a few links removed but no an issue I expected that. For the money, you would be hard pressed to get a better quality watch from an online retailer. I am by no means a watch aficionado but needed something nice to wear to work and this fit that for me., While the look of the watch is very modern and resembles that of an Apple product, it is FAR from Apple quality. But, what do you expect for a watch less than $5? Setting the clock and date is a bit tricky. I only figured it out by pressing all of the buttons hoping that I would get somewhere.<br /><br />Agreeing with others, it seems silly to have the words &#34;LED WATCH&#34; etched on the face of the screen. It's small, but still annoying and takes away from the watch.<br /><br />The wristband is wider than most watches., Awesome, Exelen my wife is very happy, AWESOME, I'm a big fan of Invicta Watches...this one is really nice for the price, great size and weight, Very cool watch. It seems to keep time well, and is very sharp looking for the price. A very good deal. The strap is very adjustable and comfortable, even for me as an adult who loves mickey mouse watches., The watch is absolutely stunning. The arm band is a lil small and it took about two months to be delivered., This watch is absolutely gorgeous. Elegant design for such an affordable price. Highly recommended!!!, More towards a guy watch unless u like big watch, runs perfect looks very nice, Found it cheaper in Walmart and it did not seem to be the quality of a Disney product, This tool is really easy to use.  It is fairly well-built.  My only gripe is that the adjustable &#34;platform&#34; part falls off easily when dialed up to the higher settings (hence the 1 star deduction.)  Beyond that small issue, it was very simple and easy for me to remove 3 links from my new watch.<br /><br />For those of you who might read those reviews saying that it is difficult to use, or that some users broke many pins, I would say that those seem to be cases of user error.  This thing really could not be easier to operate.  If you cannot take your time and figure out which way your pins should be pushed out of your band, you should may wish to just save yourself the aggravation and take your watch in to a professional to be re-sized., I love my new watch and I haven't even worn it yet! It is to big and I don't have any tools to take a link or two out of the band. I don't know if it was supposed to come with a tool for that, but it should! My only complaint is that I can't wear it until I figure out how to make it fit!<br />The watch is heavy duty, looks magnificent and will catch an eye or two, no doubt!, Wonderful watch! Smaller than I thought but its still a clean watch., excelente producto, Love the watch. Looks exactly like the picture and arrived very quick., My 9 years old loves it. It is stylish and looks good., Watch is big and looks nice. However, the packaging is really poor. When I received the package, the watch fallout of the box and inside the envelop. The watch holder is broken already and the box is cheap.I would not recommend to purchase., Top watch, its okay for a watch made in china, I've always wanted a mantle clock, didn't want anything that would be too extravagant for my home but wanted something eye catching with beautiful chime(s) ......THIS IS IT! I absolutely adore this one and I wear nothing but Seiko watches and have had them for years, so that was a no brainer for the make I wanted. It looks so well made, not cheap!  It is exactly 10 1/4h x 16 3/8w x 4 7/8d. Also of course the delivery was right on., Awesome!, Really good for the price, my  daughter really likes it., I don't understand how these people are able to use this watch for 2days or so. Cuz mine only lasts for 6~10hours. Im not a heavy user. Just read notifications and respond and what not. Think its facer app that take too much ram memory and bettery. But it does charge fast. And even thou you gotta bring the charge dock for your traveling, charge dock is small and cute so it doesn't bother you much.  My biggest concern is when I use voice control. It understand my voice reall well, but the problem is, it doesn't do the action but does Google search for example. When I say &#34;heart rate, heart rate monitor, or check my heart rate&#34; it doesn't do the action but show me the result of what Google got. I don't know its my personal problem or everybody is on the same track. Might be the language problem; I'm using my phone and watch with Korean language.  And after battery gets to below 15%, it automatically goes to battery saving mode which I can't do any actions no more than 5 seconds. After 5 seconds screen goes out and you can turn it on back for 1min. So I always stop the battery saving mode asap.  I'm using this for 2weeks so far and these are my first impression of moto360  Ok its been about a month now. and battery capacity became so much better now which was main problem that I had. I cant figure it out why, but I can use it at least 16hours or so with regular use I check time approximately 20 times and get 100 notifications. and this is enough when you wake up and leave home at 9am. and come back 11pm still battery stay 30~40% and I am very pleased with this., As good as it gets.  One of the 4 facial nuts fell out shortly after I started wearing it, but other than that no complaints, I like it but my husband don't. It's his gift but he wears it., Out of the box the watch would intermittently stop and start. I replaced the battery and the problem persisted. I wanted to love this watch because of Dieter Ram's legacy with Braun, but the build quality is not there., I love how this watch looks and feels! I am always getting compliments about it every time I wear it! Ignore all the comments about the ¨messed up roman numerals¨. It is intentional due to the design of the watch and the limited space on that watch. It is a common way to do the numerals. Just look at other people's comments who explain it well among the reviews., After doing much research, I decided to go with this beautiful classic Bauhaus design. After being shocked at the price tag of the nomos, I found the Rodina and I am more than pleased. It proudly presents itself as made in China, and is probably the best bang for your buck in terms of a classy watch. This amazon listing is for the black band, which is definitely dressier and can most likely be worn during formal occasions mostly. The blue tempered hands show up at an angle, a nice subtle touch. My model arrived with the grooves in the smaller second-hand face, and an 'R' on the crown.<br /><br />Now there are many avenues in which you could get this watch, but I chose amazon because 1. Prime shipping, didn't want to wait for overseas shipping, got it in 2 days. and 2. warranties, I know amazon has decent/good customer service, and I trust them more to deal with any potential issues rather than a random chinese watch company website. Overall, the watch looks better in person than in photos and I am extremely pleased., Excellent value for the money. Attractive and practical., It came with three, but I've only used one.  I haven't had a single scratch on it and it doesn't impede the visibility of the screen whatsoever.  Even with the screen off and viewing at an angle, you can barely tell it's there.  It seems to be made of a similar material as an InvisibleShield and applied in a similar fashion., Decent watch. So far no problems with it. It is a big watch. The buttons on the sides are a little hard to push sometimes. I do like it but rarely wear it because it doesn't conform to the curve of your wrist. So a little uncomfortable but to each their own., Gift for my dad, classy watch, cant go wrong, Updating my review from 1 to 5 stars - the first item arrived broken. I returned it, and really didn't do anything other than leave a review thinking I'd just move on. But the seller (LuguLake Direct) contacted me immediately and arranged a replacement even though the item was currently listed out of stock (even offered a discount for my trouble). It arrived quickly and works great! LuguLake Direct was very pro-active in their communication and e-mail replies always arrived same day or next day. It was very easy to work out a replacement unit.   The winder itself works great and is very quiet. I have it on my nightstand and I can't hear a thing. Overall very pleased., Awesome watch. I have always loved Casio for their strong cheap multifunction watches. But this one is totally worth the price. It has a very accurate compass, worldtime, alarm, stop watch, etc. It looks great, it is water proof, it does look very resistant.<br />For anybody who might need to use the compass function, or just want a cool looking watch (multi-funtions too) I recommend it., So the watch is perfect everything works great and it does look nice. After getting the watch though it is a bit lighter than I expected which is not a bad thing but it makes an odd noise when the band moves. This is just personal opinion but for someone looking for something that is very classy and not very expensive this would be a perfect watch., This watch is very attractive,comfortable and the dial is very clear and easy to read. The hands are blue and it looks very elegant against the white face of the watch. The clasp is very easy to operate,just depress the button that lies flush with the strap and it releases.I am only giving three stars because the date has not and will not change despite being set and reset using the instructions. Therefore I will return this watch and ask to exchange this for another. Otherwise this is a very elegant,stunning,lightweight watch., My twin girls really like it the only issue we have had since first review is that there is a little rubber type strap that you need to keep put on that can be taken off and the girls keep losing it.  With 5 year olds this is something I feel would be better if attached permanently., It is a nice watch. The band and case are clearly high quality.  Although it is larger than I expected, it isn't too, too large for me. I read discussions that the retail price is inflated and unrealistic etc. That might matter to me if I was paying that price.Time will tell how durable the Sapphitek Crystal (the crystal is flat not raised) is. I have owned expensive, movement watches in the past, but definitely prefer the accuracy and durability of quartz since Seiko first introduced theirs. It keeps perfect time and it isn't a big deal if something should happen to it. I like the look and feel and hope to have it a long time., I'm a repeat customer for the Timex Ironman watch. Even though I'm a woman with a very small wrist (and have to cut extra holes in the band). I always buy a man's watch and particularly love this model, with its large digital display and excellent Indiglo lighting. I wear my Timex when I swim laps and have never had any problem with leaking, as some have reported. Eventually, the Indiglo dies--in advance of the battery. When that happens, I know I'm ready to buy another., Awesome watch. Be certain to read the instructions first for proper programming., Stunning watch - unfortunately, it was too small for my guy., This is a beautiful watch, far better than anything most American's wear. I own 3 Bulova wrist watches already, and wear them near daily.  That being said, I am a little disappointed in this particular Bulova compared to my other 3.<br /><br />My first issue is that the Bezel, does not rotate. I would have expected this from lesser companies, but not Bulova. Second, the wristband locking mechanism is somewhat flimsy by comparison to my other Bulova watches. Finally, the watch seems a tad bulky, given that it has a fake bezel. I would have excepted the extra bulk if it was a fully functioning timepiece, however this item is definitely an example of form over function.<br /><br />Despite my gripes, it is a beautiful, and accurate watch. I could have returned it, but it was just too beautiful to part with!, This watch I was very disappointed with. It worked less than 3 days. I'm a little confused if the battery is dead or not. I works for a few seconds, then you turn your wrist to look at it and the hands are still. I'm like you have got to be kidding me... I'm thinking it must be a gearing issue, I don't know. There were no instructions on how to set it, and the watch was already ticking when I got it. IMO, when you purchase a &#34;new&#34; watch, especially if its not in a store/mall showcase, it should have those plastic things in between the knobs so the consumer can remove activate the battery at that time. I really do like the watch, but I am hesitant to wear it &#34;not working&#34;. I would hate for someone to ask me what time it is, and I don't have it..., This is a spectacular quality winder for the cost (although as others have pointed out, the logo plate on top is kind of cheap looking). Finish is beautiful outside and in -- even the packaging was elegant. It would be helpful if the pads were a little bit larger in diameter, but that's not a big deal... I'll post back (today is 8/25/15) if the motor gives out like some have complained., If I could give zero stars I would.... This watch didn't even last a month. Water got into the face and it is all foggy! Can't return the item. Buy a G-Shock instead!, I thought it was waterproof with an alarm/timer.  Was mistaken., The black frame is painted and removes by touch of a nail, I love the watch; however, after wearing it for a few days (including in the pool) the band itself has changed colors so now the watch is a weird two-tone instead of white., It appeared blue but the color is  royal blue. It was also described as sleek but it is a huge face watch., Received my box with a bit of shipping damage on the back side. The &#34;wood&#34; was scratched off showing the paperboard underneath. The box is well made and seems sturdy; but, I live on an island the the paperboard is going to sweel up like a whale on the beach... &#34;Ebony Wood&#34; = NOT! My photo clearly shows the paperboard., Horrible watch, even for the money, the shine fades in less than a week. Also the edges wear fast and scratch easily., Love the color and the face of the watch. The size everything. The one thing that's bad is the band scratches easily. I've only had it s few days and I have several light scratches in the metal band, I love this watch! The case itself is well made and it is really cool to be able to see the inter workings of the watch on the backside of the case. The leather strap is solid, well stitched and soft to the wrist on the inside. I can't wear my watch daily, so I have to set the date and time before I wear it quite often. I might recommend a battery or solar powered watch for someone that doesn't wear a watch everyday. I knew that this watch was an automatic when I purchased it, so this is not an issue for me. I hope to wear this watch for years to come., I thought it would be metallic but it was shiny plastic. It's alright and it comes with a variety of rope and chains to have variations. It was nice, Great watch. It's not only used for workouts anymore due to its stylish and colorful looks. Got two of these in different colors, BUENOS, Used this today for a 3 mile run. It was a great experience. I love the touch screen makes using during your run so simple. Even though it looks big its not heavy. The set up instructions were so easy.....I love the  music option also., After making several trips to local jewelers to find a replacement watch band in a long length, I was pleased to find it on Amazon and just as pleased to receive it within three days.  The quality is quite good--in fact, I think it's the exact band the jewelers carry--and it was half the price. A YouTube video showed me how to attach it myself. Nice to be done!, This is my first Casio Baby-G. I wanted to get a sporty watch with a little hint of girly. Was looking for something that I can alternate with my Rose Gold Nixon watch. Loved that this watch also has the Rose Gold tones that match perfectly with my jewelry. Very attractive looking. I also do not have any problem with the digital display/illumination as other reviewers have. Fast shipping and great deal., It’s really amazing watch., My husband has had the same Timex Expedition watch for many years. He just buys a new band when the old one wears out.<br />He found this band to be stiffer than the previous ones, but still finds it comfortable to wear, and is very happy with his purchase!, Love the watch.  I've had it for about a week and I am enjoying it as my every day watch.  The band which is a little stiff but is loosening up, Watch face smaller than appeared in advertisement, I have had this watch for about a month now. Great watch for $40.00. Can't beat the value. I like the metal side buttons verse the plastic buttons that the more expensive G Shocks have. I was thinking about going with a more expensive G Shock solar but realized that the solar is a newer technology in watches and is a little bit harder to read. Additionally I figured that even with a solar watch you still need to change the battery and the battery might be more expensive then the standard watch battery that you can buy and change yourself for about $3.00. I am still debating whether to just buy a cheap Casio $15.00 dollar watch next time since no matter what watch I purchase the band seems to not last over the typical span of the battery. This G shock costs about $20.00 just to replace the band then an additionally time and energy replacing the battery., First of all, this watch is not waterproof.  It immediately died upon being exposed to water on a water slide.<br />Second of all, it is almost impossible to program.  Nothing about the buttons is logical, and the instructions are impossible to understand, as they are included for a variety of watches and you have to figure out which process applies to this watch.  In short:  a piece of junk that is a complete waste of money., cheap quality. over priced., Band looks and feels great.  Awful quality though.  After re-sizing the band (removing a link) links on the other side of the watch are falling off.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more., Awesome,!, Braclet very large.Had two links removed by jewler.A very nice watch.Very good looking timepiece, Too big for a normal girl's hand. Almost humongous. Dont buy unless you have a huge wrist or a craze for chunky watches., The first thing that you need to know about this bracelet is that it's HEAVY! This may be appealing of offputting, depending on your tastes. It's well machined: As it appears, it's made of goodness knows how many individual steel bits. Love that it has screws for adding / removing length. Buckle is nicely made. It's surprisingly comfortable. Wish that it were possible to do small size adjustments *without tools* -- our wrists are different sizes at different times of the day -- but that's why I carry a spring-bar tool! Beware, the end links, while straight, are a bit 'chunky', and this bracelet doesn't fit on all of my 20mm-lug-width watches., freakin cool watch! very heavy, not for kids, which is what I was looking for., easy to view, Im generally pleased with this watch.  It looks great and i get compliments on it.  The price indicated it was marked down from $850 which is total BS.  This is a good $100-150 watch, nowhere near worth anything over $300.  Ive owned it for about a week and the finish on the band is already rubbing off in spots where my wrist rests on my desk at work.  It does keep the time pretty well - its only about 1 second off of my phone's clock which i used to sync it a week ago.  The chronograph hand runs for up to<br />2 hrs from what i can tell.  The instruction pamphlet does the job.  Overall id say this watch is definitely worth the $85 i paid for it., The watch looks absolutely astonishing, This watch is quite simply the most beautiful watch I've ever owned.  In the considerable myriad of competition among quartz watches, smart watches, and mechanical watches I was tempted to go for a smart watch.  When I thought it through, there seemed to be a nagging question about just how long the smart watch craze will really last; certainly concerning the constant changes in software and updates, not to mention the concept itself. My decision to buy this simple, elegant watch from Oris is the result of an understanding that this is a real timepiece of tremendous value, both in its quality and its purpose.  It only tells the time and displays the numerical date, that's it.  Actually, what else does a watch really need to do?  So purchasing one that I will be proud to pass on is significant.  It is one of the best purchasing decisions I've made in a long time., to heavy beautiful watch, bought it for my husband and he is happy with it/ so i like it., Kind of like a MB3. Might be fun to play around with but don't want to be caught by your friends with it on your arm., My son LOVES it..I've bought a few on here that did not last a week...this one looks like a winner..very nice..plus AMAZON gives a warranty for 2 years you can't go wrong, THE GOOD:<br />Leather quality and stitching are nice. Leather is soft and has a slight amount of stretch, which allows the watch sit firmly in place without excessive tightening (old band was either slipping around or extremely tight depending on the hole I chose). Color is nice and seems modestly resistant to scratching. Hardware isn't bad but I have had some paint chipping where my wrist would touch the table.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />The extra strap which loops through the main strap to secure the watch is too short. This causes the buckle to sit more on the side of the wrist as opposed to opposite of the watch (photo1). This also causes the tail of the strap to wrap around almost up the the face of the watch (photo2), which is unsightly. I measured my wrist to be ~13cm/7-1/8in, which puts me in the third smallest hole out of the 9 provided. I am a fairly average sized man, so I was surprised to see I was so far shifted toward the short end. A larger wrist would cause the buckle to sit even farther up the side of the wrist.<br /><br />The metal loops that hold the tail of the strap are also too loose and allow the strap to slip free once trimmed. I have to keep pivoting them to lay flat against the band otherwise it will flop out (photo3&4).<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br />There aren't a lot of options on Amazon for similar products from different manufacturers, so you have to take what you can get or look elsewhere. It is wearable, but the minor annoyances are not trivial. For the time being, I will continue to use this band but it will likely be replaced soon., Way to big there should be a way to adjust, It's an easy application and I don't see any air bubbles after a day I applied the protector. But, it doesn't quite fit over the screen as it is too small and leaves a 1-2mm gap around one side. I compared all 6 films I received and they are all smaller than the watch face., Simple, reliable. Wish I could see it in the dark though. Price is right for the quality., It came defected. The hands do not move so the only thing that keeps track is the digital clock., barely all my watches fit., poorly made - not comparable to the original - thinner and shiny, Just what you expect from a Timex watch.  Modestly stylish and highly functional.  As with most watches these days, it is difficult to adjust the date with the stem, since it is hard to get it in the half-retracted state needed., First off I  received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Now for my review. I could not be happier with my purchase. The watch is beautiful. The gold trim really sets off the black face on the watch. It looks like a very high-end watch.  I love it., Super like this watch looks nice to my hands I even bought 2 pcs one for me and one for my mom! And it's really a great deal and price when I purchased this MK watch!, I am disappointed in this watch simply because it was advertised as &#34;unisex&#34; but it is much too large for my wrist.  The package actually says it is a men's.  I'm keeping it for outdoor work as it isn't worth returning., thanks, Very nice, Fits perfect.  The only thing is that is very hard to coordinate all the functions with only one movement with the button.  It should be easy to adjust the date but you have to turn the clock 24 hours in order to advance one day.  But the quality is very nice., Love this watch.  I purchased the mens' version to have enhanced numbers and have a larger crystal as seems to be fashionable now.  The Indiglo is very helpful because it lights up the time in the dark or a dimly-lit restaurant.  Timex is my daily-wear watch for an aging baby boomer, and I enjoy the black watch band.<br /><br />Timex brand watches are hard-working and good looking.  Purchase one of the many styles., Cheap watch. Bought it for looks, very satisfied with the product (go pirates), That's exactly what I want!!, Great watch! At first i didn't know how to use this watch because its my first analog watch. But now i love it!The good part is no battery need it so no worries on constantly changing batteries!!, Looks beautiful and goes with black, brown and colorful outfits.  Also keeps time well.  I have had the watch for about one week.    Update: the band does not wear well. See picture.   Looks very worn out quickly., Amazing, Watch is stunning, but it is defective. Watch not holding its time after two days... Hoping replacement doesn't do the same., This watch is awesome looking just got it today and the shipping was more than on time. I love the stealth look of it, not to overstated and definitely not short in the looks department. I read where other reviewers said that it is hard to read the time at night, and I must say they are correct for the digital aspect, but from the analog perspective, I can see it very well. Great product, awesome looks. Thumbs up G-Shock., disappointed. it says long but not really. I wouldn't buy again, I really like this watch! The display numbers are large and easy to read. I was tired of using my iPhone 6 as a stop watch, the display would go to sleep mode. Now with the Casio in the stop watch mode it is always available to view. I walk for 30 minutes every day. The Casio is worth more to me than I paid for it, just for the stop watch. I like the watch display, very much. At a glance you see the month, day of the week. The day is displayed both is numeric and letter. Along with hour, minutes, seconds. The metal band is comfortable and nice looking., This watch was perfect for my intended use. I know that the instructions suggest that you wipe the watchband after every use. That is easily done., These watches are without a doubt cute, also they advised me it would take 4 weeks they came in less than two weeks, they can be worn with anything, and I will order again from them., This is a gift for a Doctor Who fan.  I couldn't find a true doctor who watch that wasn't plastic or wasn't going to break the bank.  When I saw this one it fit the bill.  And let me tell you - the pictures don't do it justice.  This is a gorgeous time piece,  He is going to love it., The watch is OK for the money but the watch band broke within 2 weeks !!! The clasp was put together with a bendable piece used for attaching the watch to the band...so the clasp blew apart and parts went everywhere...could not find them all.  Live in an isolated area [hence the frequent purchases on line] so only one store in our town [25 miles from home/one way] has replacement bands and they don't have one to fit and the ones they do have cost as much as the watch and band.  Disappointing to say the least., I love this watch and band.  I get compliments on it as it is a little funky while still being preppy and practical.  I have had no problems with it and it lights up very brightly when in dark.  About to buy a new strap as it is looking worn out I wear it so much., Never want to take it off!, Awesome watch. I have always loved Casio for their strong cheap multifunction watches. But this one is totally worth the price. It has a very accurate compass, worldtime, alarm, stop watch, etc. It looks great, it is water proof, it does look very resistant.<br />For anybody who might need to use the compass function, or just want a cool looking watch (multi-funtions too) I recommend it., ok, The face of the watch is hard to read with the gray background.  Comfortable and looks good but can't really recommend., I've had this watch for about a year now and this is my favorite watch I've ever owned--I get compliments all the time, Digital # are nonreadsble goofey font and # are not readble.could not git chime on hour alarm or millitary time as well, I bought the clock as a gift for my elderly mother. She really likes it. So far, it's keeping perfect time. Her only concern is that, without her hearing aids, it's harder for her to hear the alarm. I think it would be fine for anyone with normal hearing., Its the best watch I've ever owned and at age 75, there have been many. I've had it for a few years now.<br /><br />The only problem is its complexity. I need to carry printed instructions to make changes when traveling between time zones.<br /><br />The auto time update is a bit less sensitive than that for my prior watch. The prior watch watch (also a Casio) would update where ever it was in the house. This one needs to be placed in a window facing Colorado., Beware. This watch is really big., It fit my big wrist right out of the box and looks good. Head not oversized it fits my wrist., First let me say: I really, really like this watch.<br />I was on the edge for a while because it was a mechanical watch and because of how small it was.<br />I typically wear the watch Sunday through Thursday and it sits on my dresser Friday and Saturday. Due to it being a mechanical watch that means that I have to &#34;wind&#34; the watch and reset the time when I put it back on Sunday morning.<br />That being the case, it's totally worth it to me. I really appreciate the mechanical action of the watch, and the fact that I never have to replace the battery.  I've put a nice leather band on it ([[ASIN:B009LHJJNC Hirsch 109002-70-18 18 -mm  Genuine Calfskin Watch Strap]]) and I think it looks great! I have smaller wrists and I think the scale of the watch works well.<br />The included nylon band is good quality and is comfortable, sometimes I'll switch back to it if I want a more casual look.<br />I love the detailing and design of the watch face, I'm thrilled to have something like this - especially for this price!, PERFECT, Luv it!!!!!, It arrived and I was able to put my watch back back on so I guess it works.  My watch is that huge (42mm) but still had to use the biggest dies.  So if you have a bigger watch, this might not be big enough t cup the front crystal correctly., Good looking, fabulous price and works well!  Highly recommended!, When I first received the watch I was very pleased with it until a week later the strap fell apart. I had to send it back I wish that didn't happen because I really like the watch. But the customers service was great., Really nice - love timex...band is leather and the color is just like the picture, I love the way it looks but it is too heavy for the band which kind of stretches and gets crooked on your wrist.  I am already down to the last hole.  I do not intend to return it, I'd rather try to work something out.  I would like to ask manufacturer why 4 on the dial is IIII and not the correct IV?  Watch with an error?, excelent ballance between price and product., The alarm clock is in perefct size, this is exactly what i wanted. It's been 3 months from the delivery and the alarm clock works fine without any error., Adjustment too complicated, several pages of instruction, too many for a watch, digital read out too small,<br />can barely read it. Should have sent it back., it doesn't work, Real leather watchbands look awesome, but it doesn't take much sweat to make them smell terrible. This is the perfect compromise. It looks just like leather, and I've worn it a week now through hot weather and even swimming. No stink at all. Yes, the strap is thinner than some. Yes, the band is excessively long. But I've doubled the loose end back under the loops, which actually makes everything a bit more secure. The only minor quibble is that I had to punch an extra hole to make it fit my wrist., My after work & weekend watch!  Syncs up with atomic clock flawlessly, and is solar.  I never have to replace batteries or change it.  What's not to love?, The Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch is flat out beautiful! I love watches for their looks as well as their performance, so I am as delighted with the look of this stylish watch as I am happy with its performance.<br />It is a perfect watch to wear when you are swimming laps, as you can time yourself using it. Even better, the dial is very visible in every detail so you won't have to stop or waste time looking at it when you are working out. You can see it easily!<br />It has a jelly strap so you have to expect somewhat of a sticky feel when you are wearing it on a hot summer day. I don't mind it, and it plays a part in the watch's cool look.<br />If it begins to bother you, just jump in the water wearing it--because that is part of the fun of it--you can, with no worries!<br />As a piece of jewelry, this watch will update your sporty style. It is a great wear alone piece, or would goes nicely with a simple sterling bracelet to accentuate and play up the lovely silver face.<br />I am delighted with the Armitron Sport Women's 45/7051CLR Digital Clear Jelly Strap Watch, and recommend it., This watch exceeded expectations, and I especially love the box it came in., Doesn't work properly, has mildew smell :(, Love it, with excellent speedy delivery. Looks a lot better on my wrist and more expensive than its price., Buckle came apart and stem came apart before I ever got to wear it!, Amazing clock and design., I wanted an inexpensive, easy to read, water resistant watch to wear while kayaking. This Casio model satisfied all three criteria., A cool little watch. I love this Casio style. Only concern is the clip can wear out., Awesome!, I liked the watch very much, but it  was absolutely HUGE.  Had to have several links<br />taken out by a jeweler. It was more fitting for a man than a woman, and it was specifically<br />described as a &#34;ladies watch&#34;., Great watch. Wish it was indigo or something like it. (hard to see in the dark), Great hand watch, I like it, the color is as the picture and it's not that heavy. Good purchase, It is too large for a women's watch and I do not see the option to remove a link so that it fits my wrist., My 21 year old son purchased this.  It looks good and the watch face is just the right size for his arm -- some watches look ridiculously oversized, and this one is tasteful and just right., It is just what I wanted for our newly remodeled bathroom.  The clear band allows the color of the wall to show through.  It's very attractive and seems to be good quality., Did not work charge it for 2 days nothing, Perfect for all sizes of watches ..., great!! for the price.. a been to the poll many times and the watch works like a charm.. gotten many complements, sleek well built sturdy! Keeps time well and looks stylish and with out batteries that seem to run out at most inconvenient time., So I hated the band on my Invicta Russian Diver, but I loved the band on another Invicta watch I had. It inspired me to go looking for another band and this is what I found. Ironically, when I got it I realized that it is identical to the band on the Invicta watch that I liked. I popped out the old band and even was able to switch the genuine Invicta hasp to the new band and now I love my Russian Diver.<br /><br />Great product, fast shipping., I wish it would have came with a few instructions. Over all it a good product. It took almost an entire month to get her which was less pleasing., Its a timex, always works. Band could be a little larger., beautiful watch!, Arrived 2 days late but otherwise was as listed., Superb watch... :), Excellent watch, very fancy, This watch is perfect for me.. i use gloves in my workplace and this fits under it.. like the look, too.. although its lighter than what i expected it to be, but you can't go wrong with a watch this cheep and still looks good, Purchased this to go with my Citizen Eco-Drive BM8180-03E watch. This is an awesome watch band. The silicone is soft yet durable. The clasp is stainless and probably worth $5 on it's own. You do need to trim the band to length but it's pretty easy to figure out. Buy 2 if you're scared. I also purchased a metal oyster style band to go with the watch and chose this one instead. It did take a couple weeks to arrive but I think it was well worth the wait., For $150 (at the time of purchase), I couldn't be happier.  I can't believe people pay upwards and excess of $300 for smartwatches (like the Apple Watch).  I particularly like the Moto 360 due to the rounded face.  I've been complimented on it a couple times and one of them was by a friend of mine who is a fashion major, so her opinion meant more to me than others.  When I first purchased this, I originally thought, &#34;smartwatches are stupid and a waste of money,&#34; but since Amazon said I could return it within 30 days if I didn't like it, I figured I might as well try it out so I stopped knocking smartwatches before I tried one.  I initially told myself I'd try it out for a bit even though I didn't really see the benefit of having it.  A week later, &#34;hmm...I don't like that I like this,&#34; haha.  Another week later, &#34;well, if I win $1000 at bingo next week, then I'll keep it.&#34;  Three days later, &#34;I'm going to keep it regardless of bingo,&#34; but I fortunately did end up winning the $1000 at bingo :)  I highly recommend it and I've never once had battery life issues like some people complain they have., It will be a Christmas gift for my son., I got this watch for my daughter for her 17 birthday she absolutely loves it. She wears it a lll the time it goes with everything and can be dressed up or down., Battery stopped working after 1.5 years !!!  I don't use the &#34;light&#34; frequently or switch between modes.  False Ad, While i like the look of the dial, it could've been little smaller in size...comes across as a men's watch., the quality of the band is good,  but there are not attached instruction on how to adjust the band.  also it says that it is suppose to fit the Pebble watch.  it was very hard to get the band on to the watch because it was so tight and had to keep playing around to get the pins into the holes on the watch., I like it a lot. Fortunately, I know how to size bands and once I purchased a simple kit, it fits how I like it after removing a few links!, Piece of junk. I bought it for my son based on the semi-positive reviews but it broke within a few hours of receiving it. I guess you get what you pay for. It's a really cheap watch but I thought it would last a little longer., It feels very plasticky and is thicker than most every other band I have ever bought. Especially the two loops feel very plastic and cheap. Over all, it fits my watch (Bell & Ross Heritage Sport BR 123-92) well, but they are not the best watch straps I´ve ever bought., Love the mallet, love the holder.  The pin pushers are not the strongest.  Bent one pretty badly trying to size a Movado ceramic band (double barrel in that particular watch band).  Great pricing however so I'm still satisfied with this purchase., This product was exactly what I wanted and more, Couldn't read digital numbers, and the face was too big- for me., No problems at all with them.  I used them to replace the plastic strap on my Pebble., by using my watch for 20 days, the rubber strap broke…. Very bad quality! Very disappointed., Excellent watch, other than it is a little bigger than i was thinking.  that is my fault though because the item showed a size chart before i purchased., looks good and everything however, the buckle broke the first time i wore it, you can't even swing your hand like smh., Beautiful  watch. Wear it out on date or just around town. Would buy another., if you just want to have a useless cheap looking  watch as design on your wrist then you will love this. the  leds don't work properly. it came with no instructions on how to change the time on it plus its so thick and bulky. did I mention cheap looking. I mean I guess that's what you get for the price huh. I wouldn't waste your time on these. its just clutter on my table now. its completely useless. oh well. live and learn huh, Watch sits up off of the band more than I liked but looks cute for the price., I've been buying watches from this guy for a long time and I've never been disappointed with quality and service. The watches actually look so much better in real life. I have recommend him to all my friends and they are also very happy. This particular watch was a great gift for a dear friend., I like the watch, keeps good time but not in love with the leather band. Wish it had a stretch band but that will be easy to change out., Very classy Style  also metes fashion Style  great band and  time will tell about the machinery  am very happy for niw, Excellent product, Face was bigger than expected, I couldn't figure out the clasp (it didn't seem to have one--just links, which unlike other reviewers I found impossible to open) so I returned it., Excellent product, fast shipping.  Buy without hesitation., Purchased this as our son's first watch and his craze over legos.  Its great, just very hard to open once closed on wrist., Battery unfortunately died two days after I received it.  Nice looking though, Perfect, tight, fit for my Casio Pathfinder PAW 1500T!  I would recommend getting an inexpensive spring pin tool as it takes a little effort to get olds ones out and new ones in without it. I'm rough on watches and I kept bending the 20mm X 1.5mm pins the local jeweler was putting in my band. These are the OEM size and quality (or better) used by Casio., Love this watch. Durable waterproof easy to operate nightlight. For the price what's not to like. Great functional time piece, Watch arrive to my recipient as a gift. They opened it and the watch battery came to them already dead. Had to get the battery replace before it was usable., One of the nicest watches my Husband HAS ! He has a large wrist and it fits beautifully!, There are so many functions on this watch, I don't know where to begin!  It's waterproof, has a stopwatch function, alarm, date readout, light (pretty blueish light) and many more things I am sure I haven't even discovered yet.<br />It is very comfortable to wear, with the soft plastic band for a strap.  The only metal on this is the buttons you push in, the buckle and the gray thing around the face.<br /><br />But if the strap ever breaks, you will be out one useful watch, since it doesn't look like it would be easy to replace at all., Very fast shipping, the watch was easy to set and learn, I love it, It's a wonderful watch. This is my first fossil watch and I wasn't expecting it to be this good! It's unbelievable how sturdy this watch feels. I think I could drop it from a 3 story building 100 times and it wouldn't break. It's a really heavy watch as you may have seen from others reviews on this watch but the chronograph works well. It resets well! The ONE thing I can think of that I would like changed is the second hand movement! I was kind of disappointed when I opened my package and saw this was a Quartz watch. If it had the constant movement as a mechanical watch, I would be in love with this watch and wear it forever. Can't get any better than a very expensive looking and feeling watch for the price of this one! Check these out used, and if you find one for cheap, I'd suggest getting it. The band will scratch up super easy so if you plan on wearing it, get a used one. If you plan on setting it up as a decoration, go for the brand new one. What the hell. It's a great watch for somebody who wants that expensive OMEGA style watch for really cheap. I honestly like this watch more than similar styled Rolex I got from my grandfather., Be ware, this model looks more black than blue.  The bezel is black and the dial looks a deep dark blue only in bright light.  Victorinox does make this watch in a much brighter blue that I saw in a retail store.  I was disappointed with the color as I already have a black dial watch, Looks and feel like quality, exactly as pictured., Excelent, This watch is amazing!<br />I absolutely love it and recommend it highly., Fine product, Gorgeous watch. Unfortunately mine broke about a month after I got it. It would stop and start when I first got it, and I thought maybe I hadn't wound it enough. I had. Then a month in it didn't work at all unless it was face down. The seller told me to pay to send it in since its under warranty. Haven't gotten a chance yet. Annoyed I have to. Very disappointed this happened for the price. Also very loud. But very gorgeous.  Update: broke again less than a year after buying, Item did not work after two months. I left it thinking that it was the battery but the Jewelry company wants to fix it because it is already broken. Well, I knew it was not going to be for a long term deal but as good as it looks?, Looks good. Had to take three links off as I have small wrists. Easy to take the links off.<br /><br />Unfortunately the machine broke three weeks after I got it. Something apparently shifted internally and the second hand got permanently stuck. Luckily Kenneth Cole watches come with a lifetime warranty., Happy with the watch but the rubber watch band could be a little better. The band hasn't had any issues yet, but I am not sure about the durability in the long term., CHEAPLY MADE. First watch had to be replaced due to broken crown.  Replacement watch does not keep time and only runs sporadically.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT., Love this watch. Looks good and the big watch face is easy to read. As many other reviewers noted, the band seems shorter than normal, so might not fit large wrists., At first I was not impressed with this watch, but then I wore it out to a bar one night, and as I was picking up on a bartender, she said 'hey, that's a nice watch' and so now I think it was a good buy., This buckle was very easy to put on my watch band and saved me from having to toss out the band that was still in good shape!  It's nice to wear my watch again., Seems to be a strong sturdy watch so I am very satisfied at this point, Expanded like crazy once it got wet. a good 2mm too big for my watch now. Not a stainless steel buckle as I can see brass through the silver finish. I have very small wrist - like 6.25in around and because the band expanded width wise when it got wet, it also shrunk length wise. That means I have the band completely maxed out and it still just barely fits on my wrists So anyone with normal wrists beware... This expansion also ruins the strap keeper part as the wide band doesn't fit well through it, resulting in even more bunching. I don't think this is actually perlon as other perlon straps I've owned haven't reacted this way to getting wet, It is also much less stiff than my other straps. Overall I am very frustrated by this product, especially at the price. The buckle is obviously not steel, which the seller MUST know, it is pretty obvious. Plus the strap is very poorly made, which may not be the sellers fault although it is still a bad product., A nice watch. But the battery died 3 months after it arrived, Perfect fit, nice band, all the packaging and everything was correct. I am a huge Invicta fan this is a awesome watch with a great face size and doesn't weigh a ton. Would suggest to anyone looking for a nice watch., It is a worth to buy it, ligth, good look sport, im happy with my watch ;), One missing little crystal among so many really had a negative impact on this watch. i had to send it back the day after I received it.., I got 2 seikos.  Solar and self-winding.  I charged solar while wearing it on Thursday and Friday most of the day.  I got self winding Friday late afternoon.  So I put it on.  It began to work.  Saturday morning I went to jeweler to shorten both watch bands.  Self winding was easy to remove the links.  I got it back and wore it rest of Saturday and Sunday morning.  I had to leave solar watch at jewelry until Max came in on Monday.  Sunday morning seiko self winding watch STOPPED working.<br /><br /> I just came home from the jewel.  Seiko Solar watch had correct time and was still functioning.  I guess the flourescent lighting really does work on the solar watches.<br /><br />Self winding is being returned.  Then I will use refund for another solar., Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. For the price I paid I expected a better strap and watch overall. The watch face is very cheap and noticeable, and the strap is also clunky and not visually appealing. As a watch enthusiast with a multitude of watches in my wardrobe, this is not one I would ever wear. But I guess you get the price you pay., I ordered this in July 2015 from Dexclusive and the watch arrived with a potentially dead battery. I will need to bring this to a watch repairman to have the battery changed and hope that it is only a dead battery., Rugged watch. I abuse it everyday and it keeps running. Worth the price I paid for it, My son loves his watch, he is 6 years old and this is his first watch. We actually set the alarm feature in the watch and he gets up really fast all by himself (this is huge as he would normally have to be sleep walked to the shower! He's a very deep sleeper!) so he's had the watch s week so far.<br />The strap is adjustable which is great. It has an alarm feature and timer feature plus it lights up in the dark with the press of a button. Awesome watch, now I hope the company makes more in different designs for girls and boys!!, Wish it came with better instructions on exactly how to operate, but was able to locate a YouTube tutorial.  Good price for item.  Quick shipping.  Satisfied with purchase., This came with a watch band tool that was super useful. I purchased this for my LG Urbane smartwatch that is also stainless steel and this watchband matches it perfectly., Item did what it said but it was tough to get the watch to sit in the holder sometimes. Not bad investment for the price., excellent product, So far, so good.  What I like best so far is the fact that my old eyes can read the date.  Black letters on a white background work!  Time is easy to read and lume good., Perfect watch, Looks good and pretty cheap. Made thinly and feels like it could be cheaper, but its only a 13$ watch so not too bad., The center adjustable screw base, doesn't rise high enough for smaller watch bodies/thinner links!, fun but smaller than i thought as far as the fit of the ring its a little tight, The watch is cute, it has all the helpful markers to teach kids how to learn.  My issue with it is when it first arrived and we peeled the protective plastic coating off the watch face, it wasn't centered and it took all the numbers on the top of the outer watch ring off.  My son was very disappointed, he doesn't have 50, 55, 60, 5 or 10 listed anymore and it was brand new!  Addendum:  The watch face broke less than a week after the time that it is no longer eligible for return so I have no remedy and my son has no watch.  I'd look elsewhere for a decent timepiece for a child., Really high quality, came with appropriately sized posts. Highly recommend this seller., I am very happy with this timepiece.  It is in my opinion quite accurate for a mechanical movement.  I have carefully checked and it loses fifteen seconds per day or a minute every four days.  It has a classic easy-to-read face, a nice bracelet and the appearance of a more expensive watch.<br />If you are considering an automatic movement watch you can't go wrong with the Seiko SNKK65., Excellent watch., Excellent watch. Beautiful and stylish. The packaging is impressive as well., Dont buy it, very poor quality, very different from the picture, i wasted my time waiting it, quality watch strap perfect for your rugged watch. sewn well, watch meets or exceeds my expectations, My new favourite watch, just beautiful and well made too. The pics don't do it justice., I received this watch and though its unique and I love the design, it was dead on arrival. I set up a return and received the replacement today and that one too is dead on arrival. I'll be returning this one for a refund., My watch was defective and because I am in Costa Rica I was not able to return it. I had to order the machine.<br />I know the watch was on sale, but I did not expected a piece of cra.....!, Doesnt fall apart or break like a super cheap product. But for what you pay it works and is functional. Cant ask for more than than. But compared to the pictures this is way cheaper than it looks. Kind of like one of those watches you can win from a claw machine at the arcade, It ticks quite loudly.  It is also difficult to open when it is closed., This watch is attractive and has a number of great features.  I was actually surprised to see all of the features for such a low price.  Unfortunately, the watch is flimsy and has a very cheap feel to it.  The watch band is plastic and does not feel strong at all.  In fact, the watch feels like a plastic toy watch to me.  I decided to return this watch and stick with my trusty 10-year old Timex Ironman., As advertised, Perfect watch for everyday!!, Very sturdy and does the job well., AAA+++, A very nice watch! I had it for a while and wore it basically all the time and then the bar holding the leather band to the watch head broke. It happens I guess so I'm not too upset about it! All in all, I got a lot of good compliments on it, problem with wrist band coming loose., Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it., The watch stopped working after couple of months., Very cheaply made....the matte gold finish on the band was peeling off when I received it., These shoes are way to big for a newborn. They are very cute though, Well, it's not an expensive watch and I don't know what the longevity will be but it's very comfortable and had big numbers and letters. I purchase one of these, or like it every couple of years. When they get scratched or the strap gets ragged a bit I order a new one. On other watches like this the time isn't much of an issue but the day of the week is usually tiny. This one has the time/date/day of the week all there without having to push a button. The light is kind of nice too. The black numbers turn blue when the button is pushed. The dial is big but for some reason doesn't feel or look big as it seems to integrate with the strap. The velcro strap is more comfortable than other ones I've used.<br /><br />If it should give up the ghost earlier than I'd like I'll return and let you know., About the year subdial take a closer look and will see has an inner set in red of years which goes well beyond 3-4 years beyond 2015 in fact goes to year 2025 which is longer than most folks hang onto a watch. If keep watch longer than 2025 the add 10 years when dial loops back to 2016+., Beautiful watch, great for daily wear and stepping it up a knotch.<br />My one problem was that mine came completely DEAD. There was no plastic part keeping the dial out from watch face so I'm not sure if it's a lack or that or if faulty packaging :(<br />Disappointed in not being able to wear it right away- my reason for buying online has always been convince and now I've have to make TWO trips. First to get links taken out-easy enough and a given for my small wrist, and now to get a battery.  Can't help thinking the worst- was this a returned item? When they open it what will be the state of the battery?? Corroded? Gumming up the whole watch??, piece of junk.  arrived not working.  replaced battery and it worked sporadically for 2 days then stopped again.  would toss in trash but that would insult the trash!<br /><br />Thomas g. bunting, Ph.D., Just got this watch as a gift for valentines day. Have worn it only last 2 days & got compliments about it each day. Instructions are nonexistent but with short time messing with the controls can get it figured out., My Rolex bezel had scratches on it, this bezel fit just right and now I feel like I have a new Rolex watch, without the Rolex price., glass on front easily scratched, inaccurate keeping of time 1-5 minutes slow per 2 hours, otherwise looks and feels very nice, too expensive for faults I feel  Update: customer service very prompt and helpful, Was broken when arrived, band could not be fixed and I had a disappointed grandson, The watch looks great as the picture. It feels great in the hand. That part I like.<br /><br />What I really hate about it is the fact that I have to adjust the time every 5 hours. The watch falls behind about 10 minutes every 5 hours or so.  I am really tired to adjust the time. This is not what I expected from a 160 dollars watch., I Admire the Watch. Its an Eye Catcher. Unfortunately I Can't Seem to Unclip the Watch or Whatever to Wrap it around my wrist? Clueless On How To😔😓., I've wanted a Swatch since I was 18 and recently needed a watch, so I went for it.  Shipping was extra fast and I received the product within 2 days.  What looks like a navy color online is actually a dark purple, and I feel like they have the pink colors switched online, but it could just be the lighting effect.  You might be able to tell what I mean from the pictures I posted.  Even though, I love the way the watch look, I guess I don't understand why it arrived ticking.  Makes me wonder how long the battery will last.  On that note, the ticking is quite loud so I keep my watch in the LR if I'm not wearing it, that way, we can sleep at night.  The real reason why I'm only giving this product 3 stars, is that within 2 days of wearing it, I had 3 major scratches appear on the face plate.  You might be able to see them on the 2nd picture I posted, they look like 3 white lines.  This is Swatch so I really expected this item to be made of durable material that would last me the next 10yrs and unfortunately, I'm finding out the hard way that name brand or not, it's just cheap plastic afterall....  I still like the watch and will be keeping it because, well...  I always wanted a Swatch..., Stopped working after wearing it occasionally for 6 months; Asurion gave me a hard time with the warranty since I paid under $1.00 for it, I will enjoy wearing this watch, I like it a lot., Hard case. Easy to see in the dark., this watch is huge and heavy. The compass ring fell off the first time I wore it., Watch never worked out of the box, Perfect, Real leather watchbands look awesome, but it doesn't take much sweat to make them smell terrible. This is the perfect compromise. It looks just like leather, and I've worn it a week now through hot weather and even swimming. No stink at all. Yes, the strap is thinner than some. Yes, the band is excessively long. But I've doubled the loose end back under the loops, which actually makes everything a bit more secure. The only minor quibble is that I had to punch an extra hole to make it fit my wrist.<br /><br />Note: [[ASIN:B010EMO9MS The original Amazon listing]] I bought this through is unavailable now, but this appears to be the same product., The strap looks better in person and the curved springbars add an extra contured look that dresses up any watch, specially my Seiko Alpinist.  The one fault has to be the deployant clasp, while easy to work and fits perfectly to the strap, it fell apart this morning by suprise??? I was wearing the watch (my Seiko) and i heard a small piece of metal hit the ground and when i bent down to look for it another piece of metal hit the ground to be followed by my watch! It appears the someway the two small deployant buttons popped off??? I do not see how the buttons popped out as they are secured by two springs? I fit everything back together and wore the watch all day with no problems.  I just dont know what happened?  I dont know if it is a common thing, but i have been wearing the band for the last few weeks with no problem.  If it comes apart again i will just swap the deployant with a buckle no problem.  It still is a very sharp looking strap which i recommend.  Just keep an eye on your deployant parts., Absolutely disappointed with this watch the hands broke off the second day. Will never order from this company again., This is a very nice watch.  It looks as good and works as well as a Citizens or any other well known brand.  Actually I would say it looks better than any of the other brands I saw at the jewelers when I was looking. I was looking at other watches when I brought this one into the jewelers to get it sized and no other looked better.  I like the one I bought more. If you are reading this you are most likely looking to purchase something.  Many of these Invicta watches are huge in size so make sure you check out the size chart for both diameter size and thickness size.  When I say some are huge that may be an understatement.  This watch was the smallest of this type Invicta that I saw - which is the main reason I picked this one.  Even this watch is a good size in diameter and thickness as well as heavy compared to a timex or watch of that type. And, unless you have wrists the size of an Ape you'll need to get it sized.  I needed to have three links taken out. That process is somewhat painless for a jeweler.  It only took him a couple of minutes and charged me $5.00.  Good luck in picking out something!  You can't go wrong with this brand.  Oh - it comes in a really, really nice double box to keep it in.  Classy act there., The side knob fell off after two days. Have to return for credit. Bummer. My child really liked it., watch is ok. When you open the box it has very plush packaging with multiple layers. The watch is ok for the price you pay. The band is really cheap/thin and am afraid it may break. The crown and protection around it is plastic and doesn't feel super stable. You have to adjust time every so often as it lags.  I feel like if they would have put half the quality and money into the watch as they did the packaging it would probably be a decent product. Overall ok watch for casual wear, do not think it would stand up to everyday wear., I received this as a gift.  It is a very well made watch.  I have large wrists and find this very comfortable to wear.  I have gotten many compliments on this watch.  Would recommend to anyone., My favorite everyday watch. This watch has a great ETA movement, a long history, and an overall excellent value. Beautiful face which is simple and classic. I have mine on a kangaroo leather NATO strap. Other watches may try to copy, but this is the original military watch by the original military watch company., It's very nice and easy to read numbers., striped bezel  used watch appearance not satisfied with the product  very thin band, Didn't work for me, Best watch ever, I previously owned a Seiko solar watch that was all black. It worked for about 4 years, and then one day the stem knob fell off (no trauma that I could remember) and the second hand froze. Up until that time, I had no problems and had numerous comments regarding the way the watch looked. As I recall, that watch cost ~$200 but I got it on sale for ~$50 at a local department store. It was a reliable timepiece and withstood accidental swimming pool and shower exposure until its unexplained sudden death. I sent it in and the Seiko service center wanted $125 to repair it. NOW I have this one, and my review reflects only 1 week of use. GREAT - love the look which is as elegant as the old one. No idea yet about durability, but it started working immediately upon light exposure. The day/date is large enough to read without my reading glasses (barely) and definitely better than the old one. The strap is calf leather, thick and will likely not wear out. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and the discounted Amazon price, but it is early times. Also, probably due to my own error in clicking twice on my wish list or similar, Amazon sent out TWO watches. I returned one and I must say that the Amazon return process is flawless - the best consumer experience ever!, Gorgeous watch!  I feel rich when I wear it.  The only negative I would have is that it is very large and as I have a very small wrist, I couldn't get is sized as small as I would have liked.  It's too bad companies don't make jewelry for small wrists., The most recent one purchased has already failed.  The older one is still plugging along.  So, there is a level of lemons., I have had this watch for a couple years now, it still looks and works like it was brand new, Definitely worth the price.  It is larger than I thought it would be but I still enjoy wearing it., Lasted 2 weeks then stopped working.  Pretty watch but useless, the watch did not last a day, it fell off my arm walking to the train station.  Took it to the repair shop and was told it could not be repaired because<br />of a major part was missing.., Fabulous item! Easy to use! Comfortable to wear!, I am happy with my recent purchase of the men's citizen watch, it has a large numbers on the face dial, which makes it easy to read and keeps very accurate time without winding., Goo watch but the buttons are so easily bumped that the digital time can easily be reset or completely wrong. Otherwise these function great., Love this! I am an occasional runner so I don't need the expensive Nike watch that sync with my phone or computer. I just need to know how long I run rather than how far I go and this watch does it for me., cons-<br />It has red and orange undertones barely looks brown. 3 of my watch faces tap the glass, need to close slowly. lock hinge does not completely recede; sticks up while unlocked, velvet on bottom is poorly placed like a sweatshop glued it on in a rush.<br /><br />pros-<br />fast shipping, does lock although unsure of how sturdy it is, I have had this watch for over 5 years. It has been performing fabulously well. It is lightweight, and the adjustable band held up well too. Battery died and i had a hard time finding out the replacement type - not your typical battery- finally found it, and also found it for sale here on Amazon. Look for battery serial number SR616SW  - mine was made by Energizer, number 321, Great watch for the price I love the style of it. Very simple yet it's flashy so it catches people's eye which results in many compliments!! The strap is thin but it is genuine leather.  I will be replacing it just to gain a better aesthetic look of the watch. As far as the time keeping I set it to my g shock, which resets itself every night and it has been 1 week since I first set my timex yet the time stays true. Very good watch definitely recommend., I like this very much. Needed an everyday watch and like Timex !, Such a pretty watch! I REALLY like the handcrafted watches, and have gotten so many compliments whenever wearing them. The wood is a very soft, and well crafted. It does not irritate my skin, and is just an overall pretty watch. It is also very light!  This goes well with my collection of watches, and I have worn it many times. I received this item for an discount for an honest and unbiased opinion., The description said the watch was oversized, it was really really large.  I was able to return it with no problem,, Came broken. The button was broken so I couldn't wear it at the smaller size. Also the watch face was larger and clunkier-looking than I thought., If you own a compatible iPhone w/Bluetooth this watch rocks. I have been listening to I tunes on my apple I Phone 5S and my watch flashes and vibrates when there is an incoming call. Remember to activate bluetooth on the watch when you listen to music. For $29.99 this is a steal. And if your athletic the other modes will fit right into your training routine (I am now disabled and in a wheelchair)<br /><br />RTD, This watch replaced one almost identical ... Of 15 years.  The watch is exactly what I need.  Loses a star because the bands are never good.  I always have to replace with a sturdy rubber type band over the plastic/Velcro nylon.<br /><br />Timex Indiglo.  In the expedition model.  It's what for checking time., Cool!!, I purchased this watch as a gift and it was adored! The box is very elaborate and presents beautifully. The watch is too big and is not easily adjusted without a jeweler so the recipient will have to make a trip if an adjustment is needed. The watch is gorgeous and very sparkly!, broke in a week!, I gave this watch as a holiday gift. I liked the vintage styling, and the recipient needed something that could be seen in the dark (his main watch is black on black, no lume), In the last eight months, we have had zero problems with it. It's stylish, but it is also well-made. The lume is very bright. Super pleased with this purchase, as is the recipient. Would recommend!, Amazing design!! Absolutely satisfied! I highly recommend this watch:), The watch is very nice and well built , But the display is very dark and the back light could be brighter. It may work for some , but for me i need an easy to read bright display. the photo online makes it seem brighter., Watch literally fell of my wrist the second day I had it., Beautiful watch but too shiny for my personal taste. Be aware that, although the picture may suggest a brushed stainless finish, it is chrome bright. This misunderstanding has happened to me twice: no way to ask about finish and incomplete description of said finish beyond &#34;stainless steel.&#34;, Could be better with the strap. Was also expecting a more ultra slim case. Otherwise, it is presentable and too new to comment on quality or time piece, Only buy if you are a 10 year old with very skinny wrists/forearms.  Useless for an average sized adult.  Complete waste of money, This watch broke in the first couple minutes we had it. Very cheaply  made, despite its cuteness., It was a pile of crap worked for 6 hours after I opened it started calling apart on the I side and the minute and hour hand was all jacked up don't waste your money .. I really give this thing no stars but it made me do atleast one, Reason for 2 stars is that while the watch is very stylish and I trust Seiko as a brand, over 25 years, this watch is too small for my wrist and I returned it., The bracelet color looked like red wine but is more purple., Poor visible angle.See the picture please., This is the second time I ordered this product.  The first one works well, soft and looks good on the wrist.  This second one is no different.  Overall, I am very happy with the product., Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He LOVED it. Very good quality and looks super sleek. Definitely recommend., This watch doesn't work at all. I purchased this watch along with several other watches. I was given a few watch batteries, which is welcomed, but I don't want to deal with the hassle of paying to get a battery installed in a supposedly &#34;new&#34; watch. It was smaller than I expected, so it went to 4 stars. But, once I found it wasn't working at all, it dropped to 1 star. Now I'm gonna have to pay to get a battery installed...(not happy)., Just what i needed to replace my old,battle proven 10 year old G shock.  Easy to set up, perfect size for &#34;older&#34; eyes,looks awesome.  Tells time to boot!  What more can you want from a quality product?, The watch is beautiful. I can't wait to give it to my husband for his birthday this weekend.  Also it came with a special thank u note and small gift. I am quite pleased with my product and free gift. It was thoughtful., Straps are look ok, not bad, The style is very nice, but I find it very difficult to read the time, not completely satisfied at this time., Cool watch, but it's not water ressistent!, The watch is very beautiful, but it was not adjusted properly in several positions as it should be.<br /><br />Tissot should release, reliable movements, and not only nice watches, even the movement is a very probed one.<br /><br />The ETA 2834-2, is excellent. It should have been tested, and the accuracy would be almost perfect, given the fact we are talking about a 28800A/h., Looks great in the picture,  I was excited to receive it,  disappointed when I opened it.  It is cheaply made.  I couldn't set the date and whenever I tried to set the time,  the top part of the pin would come off.  It's a shame  this watch would of been perfect.  Very disappointed  sending back., Excellent price on this Daniel Wellington watch band.  Bright colors., I would purchase more of these cases. I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. great quality and i saved money because the cost is substantially higher through invicta, Cute, but the face is a little on the light side, I like it. It's a wider watch., I own a *lot* of watch straps -- steel bracelets, leather, Natos, Zulus, cloth ... -- and this may well be the most comfortable that i've ever worn. It's so soft and smooth; at first I thought that it was leather and I'd been sent the wrong one. Stitching is flawless and elegant. Comes with a set of spring bars that fitted perfectly. This is going to see a *lot* of wrist time!, DO NOT BUY!! Charge plug does not stay in watch nor engage watch while holding . I doubt if I'm doing it wrong but, there's no instruction book with this piece of crap so...., Great watch with fun to use gadgets. I bought a camo band for it thinking the leather would look odd but I am keeping the leather band on. It looks dressy in a rugged kind of way and the color is exactly as pictured., Smaller than I thought., Very nice Velcro band. I replace all my work watch bands with Velcro wrap around bands. This Vouguestrap does the job well. Easy to apply and its holding up nicely. Looks good too. I will buy more in the future., Awesome, It is too big for my female wrist and there isn't an option to remove a link, Excellent case but the key is useful only on half of it (only the upper watches are locked with it), is all plastic<br />poor quality<br />disappointed, A real beauty! Black on Black on Black styling, Unique enough to attract attention from people around and best part, an automatic so you never need to change the battery! House of Marley is a real unique brand with some great products overall., My 16yo son loves this for his b-day...makes him feel legit!, My husband LOVES this watch and he owns many Invicta's. The band is prefect for everyday wear... It's lightweight, doesn't scuff, and simply looks awesome. He's also a big guy... 6'3, 325lbs, athletic, with big wrists and we had to adjust off 2 links. Highly recommended!, Thank you, I like it it's really cool and is really easy to use, Excellent !!, Love this watch but they got dirty real fast and the color changed., The watch is beautiful, but too big for me!  Have to return it to find something similar from this brand., Super cute, but quality is low. Worn only once or twice and Knob on the side is completely missing so I cannot adjust the time of the watch. It stops or slows and messes up the time., Not a good buy.  Very hard to program.  Still can't get the time set.  About to throw it away!, I order the Victorinox and the Tissot.  The Victorinox has a feel a quality but the Tissot feels like a $50 watch.  I will most likely return it., Awesome watch.  I get so many compliments on it., Second Invicta watch , my son loved his father's so we got him one ,beautiful, Huge fan of this watch! I got a wedding band that is a combination of white gold and rose gold, and the watch compliments it nicely.<br />For the price, I feel that the quality is outstanding. It fits comfortably and has gotten a lot of compliments in the short time that I've had it, and few times that I've worn it., Nice watch for the money, first. Curren watch I own and I am very happy with it, and planning to start my collection., I just bought it for gift..It's very beautiful, I will order one for myself:), Beautiful classy style, Looks like $100 watch thank you, VERY VERY SATISFIED, IT LIGHTS UP BEAUTIFULLY, Nice watch. I love the design on it is not as glamorous as it is on the Amazon website though. But it comes Ina ridiculously large size and you have to take it to a Watch repair to fix the bands which is roughly another twenty dollars so…, Too big and clasp very difficult to open. Decent movement though. Worth a hundo, but wouldn't pay more., Everything I expected. Very elegant and sexy watch., Watch is much smaller than I had anticipated.  The band is plastic.  Some bands are plastic, but appear leatherlike.  Not this one.  It's plastic.  Can't  complain for the price and I probably should have have been more careful about reading the description., It's perfect for my watch.  I didn't notice sizing on it, but I have a small wrist and it fits fine.<br />Can't remember if it mentioned length or not, but if you wrist is not small it might not work., Nice bright shade of dark blue.  Good quality materials.  Would purchase again., This is a very nice looking watch. I bought it to do exercise and take into the pool, so I wanted something unexpensive. Totally recommended!, Very cute. Works just fine so far. Arrived quickly. No complaints., Very light watch. Works well. Fits nicely, even on my smaller wrist. I would recommend this. Fun colors!, The product quality differs from the spotless clean matching colours shown in the image. The brass had dulled, the rubber on the pliers was dirty. Different colour handles for cutter, pliers & screw driver handles etc., Easy to operate, Compass is handy. Fits well and looks cool., Has a very quality feel to it. I bought a few to use as gift boxes for some watches I'm giving as gifts, Gorgeous, I received the Casio DBC32D-1A DataBank (25 Telememo, Calculator Watch) in 7 days from Beverly Hills, CA. This is the 6th Casio Data Bank Watch that I have owned including DBC610-A (50 Telememo, Calculator Watch) and DBC1500-B1 (150 Telememo, Calculator Watch) all with Chrome Cases and Stainless Steel Bands. I selected the Casio DBC32D-1A DataBank as the closest substitute replacement for the DataBank 150, which has been out of production for some time. The DataBank 150 is still fully functional and wearable as a casual daily wear watch over about 20 years; I have repaired the broken watch case to keep the band connected about 3 times and re-batteried at least 3 times. The new Data Bank is NOT a close substitute for the DataBank 150… the only feature that is better is the larger LCD Display with Bolder Fonts and 3-line display, but not at the expense of sacrificing all of the other great feature functions, which make the DataBank Calculator Watch practical and sensible! I have no problem with the low 25 Telememo capacity since I have owned a Mobile/Cell Phone, (which has nearly unlimited telememo capacity, etc.) for as long as I have owned my current DataBank 150, but I like the advantage of being able to access my DataBank info when I am on my Mobile Phone. The watch is not metalized in a Chrome Finish like the other DataBanks but is painted in a stainless steel finish, which matches the Stainless Steel Brushed Band but will not be as durable! The Telememo Name Line only has 8 characters, which only 3 are view-able at a time while scrolling and is difficult to identify the Data Record by Name (the same problem we had with early computers) and the 2nd number line is numerical only. You cannot continue to identify the record name, etc. unless you use a number code and the line is not even long enough to contain a telephone number with only 8 number spaces and the 3rd line has only 7 number spaces in a small font size half the size of the 2nd line, which is just dumb…This designs 2nd line can only be used to display the Country and/or Area Code usually 3 to 5 numbers of the 8 available and you must use to continue with the key number on the 3rd line in the very small font with 7 spaces in groups of 3 and 4 spaces! In comparison if you are not familiar with the other DataBank Watches, there are two lines with the first line 9 spaces for Alpha/Numerical and the last 4 spaces for numerical as in country and area code. You can continue your number display on the 2nd last line 8 use-able spaces with a hyphenated number all in the same size and width font making viewing and readability easier! It is also much more time consuming and difficult to input data by having to scroll through the entire Alpha/Numerical/Symbols list one character at a time to make your selection vs. using the keypad to select between 3 or 4 Alpha/Numerical/Symbols as with most keypad programming! The Illuminator Name on the Watch Case is a carry over from the Blue Electro-Luminance Back Lighted LCD of the DataBank 150/300, which provides a good even lighted view when needed in dim light and/or dark of night at a low current draw. The new DataBank 25 Illuminator has only a single white/yellowish LED that lights up very unevenly from the lower left corner of the LCD display. These are the main features that were comprised in the new DataBank 25 design that I do not like. To provide features like 5 alarms, which you do not need more then 2 alarms, a (dual) 2 time displays provided (vs. no World Time Clock with all time zones), no count down timer, but continue to offer Stop Watch, Currency Converter and Calculator. The watch will support 13 Languages which is an over kill vs. world zone marketing, again at the expense of sacrificing practical and usable features. I can now understand why the Casio DataBank 150 and 300 Telememo, Calculator Watches are selling for more then five (5) times their original cost. I will keep this watch but it is not the value that I expected. I will continue to use my DataBank 150 until it is no longer operational… it does not have much of the chrome finish left but I can remove the chrome like I have done before and refinish by Silver Painting and Brushing the S.S. Band to match the new watch color.<br />I have since restored the approximately 20-year-old Casio DBC 1500 after searching through a dozen Silver Metallic Paint colors. I selected the Rust-Oleum Appliance Epoxy 7887 Stainless Steel as the closest match to the Casio S.S. Paint Finish @ $3.74 http://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-7887830-Appliance-12-Ounce-Stainless/dp/B0009XB3JU/ref=pd_bia_nav_t_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=168YAQ50HFMXY2DHTGY8.  The epoxy finish is slow to cure but a very hard and durable finish, which I buffed / brushed the finish with medical gauze., I ordered this watch as a gift for my 19-year-old son, and couldn't be more pleased with it. It's a much &#34;classier&#34; watch than what he's worn before, more suitable for an adult than the plastic or faux-leather styles he's worn in the past. I love the natural patterns in the wood and the carved details. On the back of the watch face, all the information (such as the Bewell logo) is actually carved right into the wood. The wood is very, very smooth, with no rough edges that might catch on your skin or clothing. It's also listed as water resistant (although not waterproof), which is a must-have when gifting a watch to a young adult.<br /><br />This is a larger watch (about two inches diameter across the face of it), so while it looks a little oversized on my scrawny little girly wrist (pictured), it's a good size for a man's watch. Despite that, it's incredibly lightweight. The band itself is adjustable up to about 8.5 inches around (in comparison, my wrist is 7 inches). The description states that you can easily make the band smaller by removing joints from the strap – I haven't tried to do this myself yet, but it looks like it would be relatively simple to do. The clasp on the watch is unique – one end fits to the other like a puzzle piece, with magnets in both ends to hold them together.<br /><br />The packaging of this watch is also quite nice, ready for gifting. The watch wraps around a cushioned velvety pillow inside of a sturdy black cardboard box; the lid of the box has a plastic &#34;viewing window&#34; that displays the watch inside. And the cardboard box comes inside of a clear plastic box for extra protection.<br /><br />This is a very attractive watch, and I would love to get one of the more feminine styles for myself now that I've seen the beauty and craftsmanship of this particular design!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own., Look closely at the picture. Not a true nato Zulu as described. It's attached to itself in one too many places, making for a poor fit and odd appearance. There's at least one ring that just sits outermost the strap without being used. Silly.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the leather is definitely a plastic joke.<br /><br />Skip this one for sure., It's very nice I love it so much.<br />I recommend this watchs from this store.<br />Sure I will buy more.<br />Thanks for you my friend., Rugged construction, built to last, perfect fit.  Moisture wicking polyester fabric keeps you cool and dry, even in Florida heat., Perfect!!!  Gray was the same shade as pictures, the watch looks amazing, have a nice weight, well made, the band is really soft and feels durable, looks incredibly sealed the case, i'm very happy, this watch accomplish all my expectations., Purchased the watch in April of this year. It came quickly and was beautiful out of the box. I've owned Invicta watches in the past and they generally last a couple of years. I'm rather hard on watches. I didn't keep the box since I thought I would never need it. That was my first mistake. After two weeks the watch stopped working. The hands inside the watch actually came loose from the center stem. I was getting close to my 30 day return with Amazon and realized I didn't have the box to return it in. I thought no biggie, I'll send it to Invicta since it was under a year warranty. I paid $87 for the watch. In order to use the warranty you have to send them a check for $28.00 to cover shipping and insurance plus pay for the postage to return the watch. That doesn't sound like much of a warranty. I sent the watch in for repair in the middle of May and they sent me an estimate for repair charges of $81.75. I called them and explained it was under warranty and I had sent in the information. They said okay I wouldn't have to pay the repair charges but they would have to send it off to be fixed. It is now August 25. I called today to check on my watch. Apparently it was sent overseas to be repaired hence the $28 for shipping and insurance. The anticipated date of return is September 22nd. That's a total of 4 months that I've been without a watch.  I will NEVER purchase another Invicta product again. Not only is their product inferior, but if you do have a problem they are not in any hurry to make it right., Had the watch for a couple of weeks and noticed condensation under the plastic face. Now I have 3 small rust spits on the dial and have not worn it since. Not happy with purchase., My item arrived used, Love this watch....GREAT watch in the UBOAT style.The price was awesome and the watch works perfectly...I've had it about 3 months and it keeps perfect time....I've owned similar higher end U-Boats(3 Welder watches abt 300 each and a anfibio abt 450)The Welders were sturdier but felt unbalanced on my wrist.This one is lighter and sits perfectly....and at about 1/8th the price.....Highly recommended., solid watch. go for it!!, This watch was relatively low cost, but it packs both features and quality that were not expected.  Nicely colored red band. Easy to use quality push buttons for the setting or selection of functions., Works Wonderfully! I tried just about everything to close the back of my watch, even tried tips from YouTube. Nothing worked until I received this Press. Highly recommended!, Very pretty but band is big and you really need to have a jeweler take the links out or you could break them very easily., This watch does not feel very high quality when you actually get it. It looks great in the pictures, though.The thermometer was way off when I got it. The instruction book recommends that you calibrate it using something else. However, that seems kind of ridiculous to me. I plan on returning this watch., Watch faded quickly! Wouldn't prefer this watch at all., It's a bit too loose the person I bought it for has a slim hand.  And the watch has no adjustments.  However it's a very nice watch aesthetically.  It came 28 days ahead of schedule.  Overall I'm pleased. The person thinks it costs alot.  It's a pocket friendly watch.  Who doesn't like to save money., It's a good watch, but the chronograph is a bit big for my wrist.  I feel as though I am wearing the tachometer out of a 70's trans-am on my wrist., Awesome, This is my first time buying an automatic watch. This watch freaks me out, because it's really good with that amazing price. Here are some photos took with my Nikon D5300! Hope these photos can help you when choosing a watch👍, Biggest issue is that the leather smells like mildew vs. a nice leather scent.  Otherwise I like it., I received wrong item. The clock face is weird. &#34;kate spade new york&#34; words are placed wrong, I think. near 25 minutes, not 30 minutes!  I really want to return but I'm living in korea, not US. Maybe Returning and Replacing will be hard work to me. This was birthday present, but now I don't know what to do. Please check the product using a little more nervous., It fits my Apple Watch Sport 42mm . I bought the Apple Watch band strap adapter that will be needed. The leather band is not too thick and stiff as it may look like. It is flexible and after a week of use it feels very comfortable. I have to cut a 5 cents diameter to allow the sensors to see my skin ., Not impressed, must be a simplierless costly solution., Excellent watch!<br />Though size is little bit bigger but looks coooool, I gave it to my Fiance for his birthday. He loves it! the only thing is the plastic is kind of a bummer. I knew it wasn't glass but it still has some of the glue on it.<br />Larger than you think, so pay attention to the measurements., Nice looking watch but the watch band is TOO big and it can't be adjusted. :-(, straps are stiff and a bit uncomfortable after long wearing, ....as compared to the white Casio analog one she also owns, the head is held by a tiny screw.  The screw seemed to come loosed quite often., Delivery was good also the packaging it's comfortable on my hand am a nurse and the jelly band is what I love reason being I wash my hand so many times that the water just runs off it it's just nice, Just received my order of this watch, which took over 10 days to receive. Now, the good. It looks great, the band is nice, and the band is comfy.<br /><br />The bad for me. It is heavy, and, unlike a few watches I own of similar size, it ends up rubbing my wrist bone because of where the strap points are. That's me. You might like it.<br /><br />Here's my real problems: according to the on-line manual, the battery will need to be replaced in two years. You can get that long with a regular battery. Most solar watches should last about 10 years. According to an email reply from Shark, the manual means it can last 2 years with charging. There are other contradictions in the manual, though.<br /><br />More ominous, the manual states &#34;Direct exposure to the sunlight will cause the watch overheat at the surface&#34;. What? It's a solar watch. Shark told me &#34;you don't need to put the watch under the blazing sun for quite a long time.&#34; What is a long time? I'm very concerned when I read about a solar watch overheat in the sunlight.<br /><br />So, it's going back., One of the Seiko alarm clocks I purchased does not work. How do I return it for a refund?, Great watch. I've had it for about three months now and it has kept perfect time.  Used it on four snorkel trips without a problem.  Very easy to read when under water.  Highly recommend., I got this watch less than two weeks ago and suddenly it stopped working !!, Very cheap as a quality and price as well. We I received it it was broken., The violet color so light and it looks like a men's watch... The rose gold and blue dial was much better..., I was very disappointed. The backlight is very week, settings are impossible to figure out even with the directions. I loved the look and the band is much better than plastic but I sent it back., Comfortable, well made. Fits Small to large wrists. Good velcro.  Ordering my second one after one year of heavy use in and out of water. Very nice it comes with two new Spring Bars too!, can't see the display, even when the light is on. on sunny days forget it. waste of money., Fits my 6yr old well.  Still going after 6 months., It has what I need for my workout, Absolutely beautiful, and wonderful price!, This is a solid and well built watch! This watch is pretty heavy and I thought it would really aggravate my sensitive skin since it can rub back and forth throughout the day while wearing it especially due to its weight but it didn't aggravate me at all! The face is extremely clear and easy to read with just a quick glance, The hands seems to move very smoothly and you can barley heart it tick when you hold it up to your ear. Some of my older watches tend to get a sticky type of feeling on them when they get wet but after showering with this on I can say it doesn't happen with this watch., Looks sharp and works well.  A little on the big side.  Will see how it &#34;lasts&#34; over the coming years.  Good value if it holds up., It's worth the price looks very nice, Purp, Cute little kiddie watch, but beware! It is NOT waterproof at all. My daughter wore hers into the swimming pool a couple of times, and it first fogged up and then eventually died. Pretty silly with the &#34;30M&#34; boldly staring at you from the front of the watch! It's a shame, because it's a neat watch otherwise (well, other than the weird offset of the right-hand number on the face of the watch)., Love it. A bit smaller than I expected, however it is a beautiful watch., Many, many compliments, It works., I've been waiting about a year to purchase this watch and finally did and I'm happy to report it is everything I expected and more. The watch looks like $1 million and it is very high-quality and extremely stylish., weak pins,broken in seconds.cheap china made product, This is a very nicely constructed watch case. I can only fault it for not having a means to prevent the bottom drawer from pulling completely out. I initially thought I would have preferred that the top part have 10 individual sections, but it turned out that the two large cushions perfectly held groups of three smaller diameter watches., Very comfortable.  Easy to set. Vibriant cors!, Excelent Thank you, Wow!!?, It looks big to my hand maybe because I usually wear small watches ... But I love the watch the color and the great deals and price! Comes with the MK watch box !, Nice watch. However i am disappointed that it isnt even at the very least water resistant, A nice watch that's versatile, goes with almost everything, and the price is certainly right. Three caveats, though: The contrast between the numerals and background is not nearly as marked as the photo makes it seem, so if you want a fast read, going with an Easy Reader model may be wise; the background color of the dial seems essentially black, not brown (as other reviewers have noted); and the strap is pretty cheap and merits replacement. The Hadley Roma oilskin straps are nice, but many folks may balk at dropping $18-20 on a strap for a $30 watch., Very pretty. Very happy with my buy, Nice looking. Large display. Comfortable bracelet., Great watch, but the band nearly fits around my wrist. I have to replace it with s bigger band., Watches were very pretty, they looked great on your wrist.  Did not need all three colors, really liked the silver one the best., Not thrilled with this purchase. It's not as nicely made as it looks. Feels cheap The strap that holds this to the belt is flimsy, and the snap on it does not secure well causing it the case to fall off the belt. Stay away., Something is wrong with thickness of band receiver. Fits too tight and hard to remove from watch base, Everything was as described.  Will do business with again., Graphics very light and time cannot be read. Ordered for 5 year old so he just likes the watch but wish I would have known the quality. However fast shipping, Quality not as expected. Fits perfectly though., No surprises here, you get what you pay for, a cheap plastic watch. No instruction manual, setting time and date is trial and error., Awsome watch..., The watch has some mechanic issues, the watch back says the battery will last till november 2016, but it delays 3 or 4 minutes every hour.<br />I have taken this watch to many watch repair center and changed like 3 times the battery and they keep on telling me the bettery is fine, the problem is the watch.  What can i do now?, I buy this for my husband and I'm glad he likes it Looks real gold and it is automatic you need to wear all the time..he said he receive lots of compliments., It's an easy to read watch., Love it! Does everything I need it to do and it looks awesome!, Like the easy to read dial, and the illumination - like that I could easily adjust the strap to fit my small wrist.  Hope the Velcro will not become clogged and unusable - also very happy with the durability of the watch., For me a big plus is that the Bluetooth was easy to set up and connect to the iPhone and secondly the display is very clear and easy to see.  The find my iPhone feature is nice just in case I leave the phone somewhere in the house and can't find it.<br /><br />The calendar alerts from the iPhone also show up on the watch and cause it to vibrate to alert to appointments.  Also can alert if an e-mail comes in or a text message., Gave this item as a present and they absolutely LOVED it!!, I am very pleased with this watch, which I intend to use for sailboat racing.  It has been easy to learn how to operate it and the screen is very readable in direct sunlight, even while wearing sunglasses., Excelent!, A link broke the first day I wore wtf, Has all the stuff, works well, It is the only wrist band to replace my Seiko's broken band. It is perfect and I am very happy to find that in Amazon., A really nice strap if you can get it under 20, as I did.  Less value at the typical 35-45 price. Green is not consistently dark throughout the strap as pictured, several shades lighter in the grain, and especially the keepers. Teju is of very high quality, and the strap should be listed as flat or very lightly padded. This is likely new old stock as I believe Speidel is out of business for several years now. Marked Austria, so may be made by Hirsch factory and rebranded. Unique color is a nice variation for my watch collection, but this wouldn't be a primary choice if you own less than a handful of watches or change straps often.  I have it on a 50s era Benrus 3 star and it enhances the vintage look., very easily destroyed...., Should be a women`s watch. Band and watch are too small for the average., My son loves this watch, it would get a 5 star except it broke after 5 months. The pin on the band that holds the band together broke in half while he was wearing it.  When I called customer service they said the warranty only covers the inside workings of the watch. A pin that breaks in 5 months is defective. I should not have to pay them to fix it!, best value in analog watches ever.  Doesn't gain or lose even 1 second per week., BUENOS, If you are looking for a light and inexpensive watch that is built like a bull, look no further. This watch has a battery that'll last longer than you and can survive a thrashing. You can even wear it while showering (but preferably don't swim with it)., The watch has an excellent look for being so cheap, but it makes sense that the watch is so cheap because after two days of wear the clasp broke., The quality is very good.  There is a tab to prevent the strap from coming out of the loop that works too well; it is a minor struggle to pull the strap out of the loop when removing the watch.  Maybe it was just me, but I had a devil of a time getting one of the pins into the hole; the hole for the pin in the strap seemed to me to be machined a fraction of a mm off, making it difficult to get the pin to &#34;spring&#34; into position.  I would not begin replacing this strap, which is more difficult to replace due to Timex' original design, without special watch tools available in many inexpensive watch tool kits., Wonderful product, it´s the second time I´ve bought one of these and they break in beautifully., Keeps time looks beautiful. That's what I wanteded. That's what I got excellent., I bought this case for my husband because he collects watches and he absolutely loves it!  So do I!, We bought this for everyday use. It is a very beautiful watch and my wife loved it., it's the best watch I expected. it use for mountain tracking. good functional and multiple use. never regret choose I did, Cheap, cannot size!, This is a great watch. I bought a Timex a while ago and it stopped working within a couple months. I replaced the battery but that wasn't the problem. I decided to try Casio next. I have been very pleased with this watch, no issues. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it too. It's very comfortable, and water resistant. I've swam with it with no issues. I also wash a lot of dishes. I like that it dries fast. I expect it to last a long time!, Wow this was much more then I expected the band was great I was a little worry about the plastic band 😉, Niece loved it and it got here way before it said it would ., Pros:  Nice clear dial, works fine after months of heavy use.  Clean looking.<br /><br />Cons:  The band that comes with it is poor quality, and very small.  Had to buy a replacement.  The dial doesn't glow in the dark, at least not that I could see, maybe it was very low., Georgeous, I bought this for Father's Day and my husband loves it. He receives so many compliments., thanks, Very poor instructions with watch.  Doesn't say anything about battery replacement or maintenance.  The band was way too big for me.  I-m thinking of returning it.  Very, very disappointed., It is perfect!!! Very light and I don't even feel I have a watch on my arm., I wear my watch every day !, Watch stopped working in less than two weeks, The watch not work., This is may first Swiss Legend Watch.  I do admit, I like collecting watches as they are my only form of Jewlery ;)<br />As much as technology has marched forward, it seems analog watches are still as popular as ever, strange, huh... all those mechanicals never got replaced by high tech electronics.<br /><br />The packaging and storage case is superb, so are the instructions.  Although, I don't use a watch for much, other than glancing at it and telling time.  But if you like all the twist dials and small inner timers, this watch will not disappoint.  While a few other reviewers mentioned this watch is too large for most men... I would somewhat agree...while I prefer a large face dial, this one is adequate, but its the thickness makes it quite the beast on your wrist.  And it has some weight as well.... its noticeable.  So, for those sensitive to heavy watches or watches that &#34;stand out&#34; due to size, this is not a good fit for you.<br /><br />Time setting was a little different, but the instructions take you through it... I did try to experiment with the inner dials, and they are too small for me to see well... the date is small as well.  The blue tint in person, is NOT as strong as the picture suggests, it has a very slight blue tint, noticeable, but not overwhelming.... a nice touch IMO.<br /><br />When you look at this watch, at first glance to the average person who is not a watch enthusiast, it can be mistaken for a watch MUCH more expensive... as those watch enthusiasts know, similar looking watches can cost thousands.  The best switch watches today cost over 6 digits!  So, I would surely say it passes the bling test, if that is what you are after!  And at this price point, that says a lot.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice watch for the price, IF, you like em big n heavy and a want bling on your wrist.  Its not for everyone for sure... but a LOT of watch for the dollar...., I've had this watch for almost 2 months, and my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. I'm just amazed as to how beautiful it is in person. It's just the perfect size, accentuating one's wrist while never overpowering it. The round section in the center with the pattern design adds a very nice distinction and flair. The transparent back showing the watch's inner mechanism is just cool, no other way to describe it. And the dark brown handcrafted leather band adds a final appeal to it, and what's more, it doesn't require much breaking-in. At first glance it's obvious that this is a very high quality watch, and if properly cared for and maintained, will give you many years of use.<br /><br />But as aesthetically nice-looking as this watch is, it wouldn't be worth owning if it didn't maintain accurate time, an issue that's present in many lower-priced automatics. I have tested this watch's time-keeping ability against my battery-powered watch, and it has passed the test with flying colors. Not once have I had to re-set the time, which I needed to do literally weekly with a Kenneth Cole automatic I bought recently (needless to say, I no longer have that one).<br /><br />A quick note about winding. If your intent is to wear this watch regularly then you should have no issues. But if you plan on not wearing it for days at a time, or even longer intervals, I'd suggest investing in an electrical winder so that it will be ready to go for you whenever you want. I'm no watch expert, but I don't think it's a good idea to just let it stop and then re-set the time over and over again, as that would surely place excessive and unnecessary wear & tear on the crown., Large, heavy watch. Feels sturdy and rugged.  My only complaints are that the digital seconds and the analog seconds are not in sync and after 24 hours are off sync by 5 seconds.  My other complaint is that the lower left button controls the change of digital time by pressing it normally three times in a row, so if I accidentally bump the watch, I'm frequently in time change mode., Update.  I must have gotten a junker. Sent it back and requested another one.  This one is great.  Perfect for sailing.  Barometer is right on (within 2 hours) and the moon phase is accurate.  Still need to adjuct the altimeter., Love this watch.  Very high end look, designed in Italy, made in Switzerland and for the price a steal.  Perfect size, comfortable fit and gives Cartier Tank a run for the money., Beautiful timepiece. I get a lot of compliments. Keeps great time and looks amazing on my wrist., solid steel.  fits perfect., Nice watch, good weight. I like the features. But if you are not in a really bright room you need the light to see the screen., Very pretty, This watch appears to be very expensive, its light in size, and stunning to look at.  Sometimes, we just cannot afford a nice watch, so there is nothing wrong with one less expensive., This is the worst watch I have ever owned.  About a month after purchase, I was sitting on the sofa and as I rose, it fell off my wrist.  One end of the strap had fallen out of its holder.  As I tried to reinsert it manually, one side of the holder broke off from the rest of the watch., This is a easy to read  watch because of it's size and backlight . The band length may be the only drawback for some., The watch dimensions are expressed accurate in the description. Its a very nice looking watch. This watch could easily be mistaken to be much more expensive. It has a classy look to it and goes with almost any outfit. The leather band is nicely made and seems as though it will last some time. There is no date. There is military time and a timer. Cheers!, Nemesis has progressively made this watch more cheaply over the years.  The one pictured demonstrates how it looked when I got it the first time, and it included a higher quality leather band.  The second time, all the indented curly-q embellishments on the face on the face of the watch were gone and the weight that is supposed to wind the watch continually got stuck after a few months, and the third time, all the issues with the second watch were still there AND the leather band was mediocre, being poorly dyed (looking like it was paint brushed) and the prongs of the buckle were made out of cheap flat metal rather than the stronger, solid bar of metal the first two were made of.  SHAME on this company for sacrificing so much of the quality of this product to save a few dollars., I've had this band on my Seiko for a little over a month and it is already falling apart. It is a shame because the band looked beautiful when I got it and still looks pretty good right now except for the stitching on the side that is coming undone. I've worn it every other day just to classes and such, so it hasn't taken much of a beating yet the quality of the band is not great. I'm severely disappointed as it looked great with my watch and was hoping it'd last much longer, you are better off buying a cheaper band for equal quality or spending a little more on a longer lasting band. I have included a picture of where the band split so potential customers can see for themselves., It is a basic time machine, it ha just a melody to wake up but it works., I really like this watch, but the two problems are that the strap is a little on the short side, meaning that it comes undone from the little holder rather regularly. Not all the time, though, but if it were a little longer, it'd be perfect. And I have normal size wrists.<br />The bigger problem is that the hands on the face are white against white. My vision is still very good, but I still find it difficult to see the time if I'm not in bright light. I don't mind using the watch's light, but it seems silly to HAVE to use it just because of a design flaw.<br />Other than those two things, it's great., For a first generation smartwatch, it's perfect., I love this pocket watch. It is so beautiful. I think it might not last SUPER long because I have children who play with the release, but it was so inexpensive, I will probably just order another one., I got this form my significant other's 30th birthday. It looks exactly like the picture and it looks awesome on him., I bought this watch as a gift for my wife.  Within 2-3 months, the arm band turned light grey and no longer matches the white color on the face of the watch (around the silver).  Also, the silver face of watch just also fell off (at 8 mths - after I gave it to her) and condensation has formed under the glass.  The watch was purchased less than one year ago.  She loved it at first, and wears it every day.  We just had a new baby, so she hasn't even worked out as much as normal/had the watch out in the elements.  I can only imagine that if you were wearing it for it's true purpose (working out), it would have broken down even faster. Very disappointing!, This is a beautiful watch, I bought it for my husbands birthday. He likes unique watches and I thought this was something he didn't have. The first watch we received was not keeping time correctly and we figured out how to change the battery. Once we changed it the watch still did not keep time correctly, I contacted the company and they replaced the watch quickly and efficiently. So far the new watch has kept time great. I am excited for him to be able to wear this more often., This leather strap was great addition for my Timex Weekender, I don't know much about leather but it doesn't feel cheap and feels like good quality. The strap is also comfortable and fits me well., Such a pretty watch . Classy looking and suits my needs as I am an RN and need the second hand . Love it . Well worth the money ., This is attractive but I will need to return this item----it's too big and I can't use it., The watch arrived in a mailer envelope (not unusual) but no protective packaging at all.  The watch was in a plain clear plastic pouch.  The watch did not work at all.  DOA.  The stem did not move the hands forward or back.  Nothing worked.  I promptly got a refund and set this one back.  I did not want to take the risk on another.  Like the old adage goes &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;., Nice lite weight sports watch!  Directions to set properly are outdated however., Thus far, working perfectly and a lovely box!, keeps great time, easy to read. Just a nice piece., Exactly what I wanted! Large enough to read, and it's all at one glance., A cool watch., Outstanding buy!, Best watch I ever bought in this price range!, This is an attractive watch, and the wood makes it quite unique. It works well and is lightweight on my wrist.  The leather is fairly stiff at first, but should soften up over time.  The white color may show dirt easily (the nature of anything in white), but the leather should be able to be wiped clean without a problem.  If I could make a few improvements to this watch, I would prefer the Woodies logo to stand out less (perhaps be white or a darker 'wood' color), and also for there to be a few numbers for ease of telling time (12, 3, 6, & 9), or simply marks where those numbers are. I think the black & gold version of this watch has those features, so I'm not sure why this one is different.  Otherwise, I would definitely give it 5 stars!  (If I could do over again, I'd order the black & gold version since the design seems to suit me better- I still might so that I have both styles). As a note, I received this watch at a discounted price for my honest review., Just what i wanted, It's very nice watch it seems a cute good time I get a lot of compliments on it a couple people thought it was a Rolex, These batteries are garbage. A couple out of the pack lasted for a short while, most died almost instantly - my intended use was a Toyota key fob for my car. I had to change the battery every couple of weeks or sooner on most. Some were dead right out of the package. Save your money and buy a name brand. These are cheap for a reason., They all came broken., just as seen on display, and its working properly..., I bought this watch for my husband. After waiting several weeks for it to arrive (it was coming from China), my husband wore it for the first time and, while unbuckling the strap, the pin that attaches the strap to the watch pulled out. We were able to put it back in. A couple of days later, my husband wore the watch golfing, which seemed reasonable since it's a &#34;sport watch.&#34; While swinging his golf club, the pin in the strap came loose again and the watch flew off his wrist. The pin fell off in the process and was lost. I would also offer that this watch is pretty big, even on a man's wrist., somebody knows the weight (pounds) of this watch?, Pretty watch - runs well - wears well - nice and clear watchface.<br />Highle recommended - good price., Oustanding sport watch..exactly what I was looking for - and at an excellent price., Five stars, I've had this watch for almost a month, and my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. I'm just amazed as to how beautiful it is in person. It's just the perfect size, accentuating one's wrist while never overpowering it. The transparent back showing the watch's inner mechanism is just cool, no other way to describe it. Having both the date and day of the week is a nice feature, although it wasn't a vital feature for me in my purchasing decision. And the black handcrafted leather band adds a final appeal to it, and what's more, it doesn't require much breaking-in. At first glance it's obvious that this is a very high quality watch, and if properly cared for and maintained, will give you many years of use.<br /><br />But as aesthetically nice-looking as this watch is, it wouldn't be worth owning if it didn't maintain accurate time, an issue that's present in many lower-priced automatics. I have tested this watch's time-keeping ability against my battery-powered watch, and it has passed the test with flying colors. Not once have I had to re-set the time, which I needed to do literally weekly with a Kenneth Cole automatic I bought recently (needless to say, I no longer have that one).<br /><br />A quick note about winding. If your intent is to wear this watch regularly then you should have no issues. But if you plan on not wearing it for days at a time, or even longer intervals, I'd suggest investing in an electrical winder so that it will be ready to go for you whenever you want. I'm no watch expert, but I don't think it's a good idea to just let it stop and then re-set the time over and over again, as that would surely place excessive and unnecessary wear & tear on the crown., tthank you, Keeps time, able to adjust volume of chime is great along with able to silence it at night. The only problem I have had is the pendulum stopped a couple of times. (didn't affect the time though)., Worst tool kit ever. I wouldn't call this a tool kit, the tools break so easily, the room used to unscrew the watch backs is too small so it literally cannot fit the watch, and they all have a strange smell. This should be called a handful of metal objects., Came brand new with all booklets!!!, Looks great and feels good on the wrist. But time will tell how this time piece lasts and if it is really water proof as described and, and the gold finish bracelet does not wear out too fast. So far it is keeping good time., It is amazing how off this watch is., It works well and is beautiful. However, it should be noted that the clasps on these clocks are easily broken., Very usefull. Not the best of all android wear watches but not the most expensive too., Gorgeous watch for the price!, Very easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to see the time, etc. haven't had it very long, but so far I am very happy with it!, I bought three Invicta watches Looks nice but after a year the dials on the 6412 stopped working the 14381 gets water inside every time I am in the pool, for a diver's watch that is an issue :) the third one 6749 my dress watch stopped working all together after one and a half year, I used it three times, Looks childish on, This is my daily watch. It was easy to remove links for sizing, and is super comfortable. Keeps time & date perfectly. Zero issues after many months of wear and abuse., I really wanted to love this watch. I had a jawbone and wanted something small on my wrist with the time. This watch kept losing time or just stop working. I would say it worked for a few months before it died. It is small and for that it worked great. I would look around, but if you don't mind replacing it after a few months, then go for it!, Very cheap watch. Flimsy unlike the old solid seikos, I didn't realize how skinny the strap would be.  It's not a bad watch though., It met my expectations., Excellent value divers watch. Gotta love the &#34;monster&#34; from seiko. Iconic timepiece...., turns my watch into a fun wearing thingy thing.  makes me wanna sing about li hing.  cuz, it's orange ... either u get it or u don't. I got it and I like it now it's mine. aloha, My friend bought me this watch for my birthday. After many attempts to set it ( as i try to position the hands one or the other with stop and sometimes when they cross over each other they stick together for a few revolutions) i finally got it right. I then put it into my pocket and walked about 20 feet and pulled it out to show my girlfriend and, according to the watch, nearly 4 hours had passed. Just as a test, I then took note of the displayed time and placed the watch gently in my pocket. I immediately pulled it out and 2 hours had passed. So it would appear that this watch helps you travel in time. I should give it to my friend so he could go back in time to before he spent his money on this junk., The timepiece itself is actually very good quality, however, the band is a bit lower quality, it's not peeling or separating yet, but I can see that it is on the way of doing so.  Not a huge deal when wearing but when off, it will separate.  But overall, very happy. Especially for price., watch pin bracket broke immediatley.  returned it before ever using., I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend, and she loves it! The picture honestly doesn't do the watch justice. The quilted face of the watch is always catching the light from different angles, so it kind of always looks like it's subtly sparkling. I was worried the the gold frame might be a bit gaudy but the neutral color of the band really tones it down. The watch has a quality weight to it without being heavy, which is good because she has small wrists. All in all, it's a fantastic watch, and you can't beat the price., This is my second Seiko solar watch.  The only thing wrong with the first one is that I was tired of it and wanted one a little &#34;dressier&#34;.  One of my friends liked mine so well she bought an identical one.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking for good value and reliability., This was a waste of my money., WAS DELIVERED ON TIME BUT DIDNT WORK! NO INSTRUCTIONS.<br />DIDNT SEEM TO BE WORTH THE SMALL PRICE.<br />RETURNED IT., Arrived in Midwest 11days after purchase (faster than expected). Lume on hands better than expected, no lume on dial. Strap better than expected. One of the subdials is a 24hr clock (at 4pm it would point to &#34;16&#34;).  Only drawback is questionable water resistance and I wouldn't swim with it. At this price most of the money must go to shipping. Nice fashion watch., I like it, Beautiful watch with a very poor band. The face is very nice, great details on the numbers. This is a bug hunk of metal, which I love but its very heavy and very thick. Mine runs a touch fast, but I'm fine with hit. For an entry level Swiss Auto, it's is a great addition to any collection. The case back is cool, but ultimately a non-factor for me.<br /><br />The band is bad, just bad. Broke in the first 2 weeks. I don't think it was meant for long term use, more like a placeholder until you put you own band on. I'm switching over to a NATO nylon strap since this is my casual watch.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy at this price, plan on replacing the band., I tried repeatedly to set the watch in the time zone that I live in without success!!! The digital read out is not aligned correctly on the watch!! Tried repeatedly to contact the sender without success!! I will never ever order anything from them again. I respect Amazon tremendously and I have never experienced an item like this one! Awful product! 12, I was extremely pleased with the watch winder.  It has a very nice blue light which is not bothersome when it lights up at night.  It made a great gift and works well for winding the watch., WORST WATCH EVER!! Poor Quality. It changed color in less than 48 hours. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BUY! The wait to get it was longer than the amount of time before the watch changed colors, Cool. Cheap., The face was much smaller than I expected, Nice watch. Comes on a dark grey which might throw off some looking for the darker color that the picture shows but I thoight it looks better in the gun metal color it comes in. Functions well and is a good everyday watch for a bargain, beautiful, Placed order and arrived before expected date. Product came undamaged and exactly as detailed in posting., Okay case for the price but not very high quality, This product arrived with one of the battery caps off and I have tried several times to put it on, I now must take it to the shop which will cost me not happy. This is my first issue with this vender and I have purchased many items all with no problems., So, this watch is really pretty an all but it stopped working after a day. Unfortunately it doesn't look like you can take it apart to change the battery.. But it was really cheap so ya get what ya pay for, I had to return this because of broken strap., Even more impressive in person!, Great watch.  Have had it for a few months now. Gotten a lot of compliments.  The orange textured side is amazing as one reviewer pointed out and was nice enough to include a picture showcasing it.  It is a big watch with fairly solid heft to it(which I like) but I know some dislike large watches.  Main downside is that it's fairly useless to read when it's dark resulting in downgrade of one star, as there have been many a time I couldn't read it.  Really wish it had a light button., It doesn't work. Have to send back, You must have small wrists., I love the size of the watch it's perfect for someone who has a small wrist., Way too expensive for a cheap japan movement, its jus tbecause of the brand! get a pretty swiss watch for that money!, They are very cheap looking; they are not comfortable to wear., its ok, Supper, Can't imagine a better watch for the money.  Very stylish and functional.  Feels, looks and performs like watches costing much more.  Love it., Chunky but lightweight wood watch feels and looks awesome!<br />Received several admiring comments from people on my first wearing!<br />I really like this natural alternative to the hightech Apple watch :)<br />my only concern is the clasp, that can be a little tricky to open/close, Exactly as described. Gorgeous watch and arrived fast!, I purchased this watch with great anticipation.  For the price, the watch has everything you need for hiking without GPS.  The only problem is that it is extremely difficult to read the digital display.  The units are very small and become washed out with the background. I returned the unit and purchased a similar Casio with a contrasting background; black numbers on a white back ground., High quality watch band.., ok, My husband has had the Casio G-Shock for a long time.  He is happy with this watch., Do not buy this if you have the moto 360 it will not fit, stopped working after 3 months, does what it is supposed to do, Looks nice and the numbers are easy to read. Keeps good time., Love the watch...it is beautiful. Had some difficulty setting the date at first but when I finally found out how to do it I was able to set the date easily, This was a gift for my girlfriend. A few of the crystals on the watch face fell out on her first day of wearing it., I purchased this watch to replace a 3-4 year old Armitron watch of roughly same features and appearance.  The old watch's wristband had broken and I figured it was time for a replacement.  The new watch is exactly as expected.  It keeps great time, has all the features needed, is waterproof, and looks very nice on my wrist.  No one is going to mistake it for a Rolex, but that's not why I bought it. Great value too., Had this watch 1 week before the battery died....., This watch is just what I wanted - The face is large enough to easily see, setting it was a snap - the directions were straight forwarded.  The band is something - it is a little large for me, fits well and feels OK on my wrist. I'd by another one just like it if I lost this one. Blessings, Richard, Thin and light as I wanted.  Also quite a large dial.  Seems to be on time.  Looks pretty elegant.  I am used to cheap watches, as I just want to know the time.  Still, this one does not look cheap., Really nice simple watch.Doesn't come with much features (which come to think of it i didn't really use but its a GSHOCK so i just expected more). Don't really the band., its ok, one storage compartment rotates slower than the other upon testing of the product. I guess what you pay for is what you get., cool, I have 2 young boys who share a room, 7 and 3 year olds, and this was purchased as a &#34;back to school gift&#34; from me for them. They love it! They even started practicing waking up early for school 2 weeks before the school year! The alarm is loud enough, there is a light-up feature, and it's easy enough for my oldest to operate on his own., Not properly sized...  They work but you could strip a wind point...  Use at your own risk if you know what you are doing!, The color of the band is a really light brown.  I didn't think it went with the face at all.  Disappointed., This is so far below expectations it is mind boggling.<br /><br />Doesnt keep my Bulova or Seiko wound and it was a huge waste of money.<br /><br />Support is non existant and none responsive to requests for assistance., Very sleek and feminine, like another reviewer mentioned.  Very classy looking for a sports watch. So far, I am loving it., I've owned a lot of running watches, and have always had to choose between a band which fits my wrist band an easy-to-see display until I tried Armitron.  This watch is waterproof and nice enough looking that I haven't been taking it off, even for work., Cheap watch, broke the first time I wore it., gorgeous, I got it for my boyfriend as an anniversary gift (he has been wanting it). He loves it and looks very nice., Very cute design. Alarm is terrible. The beeping stops after a minute and never comes back on. DO NOT BUY FOR A HEAVY SLEEPER!!!, just love this watch. only bothered that it doesn't display the month (only the date). this is something i could have discovered before purchasing by looking more closely at the product description though.<br />i also didn't realize the strap is a three-piece velcro strap (easily seen in the video on the product page). i waver between liking this and wishing it was just a two piece velcro closure.<br /><br />love the colors though. wear this as often as i can., Excellent value., Bought this to wear while jet sking. I have an electronic dash clock, but its easier to just glance at my wrist. Easy to set the time and date. Lightweight: I don't even know its on my wrist.<br /><br />Con: After I set the band length for my wrist, it slightly stretched and the band slides down my wrist. I've tightened it again, still slides down, but its still snug enough that it won't slide past my wrist, I just wanted it to stay above my wrist bone. Guess its just to be expected. Not really a deal breaker. Also, I thought the watch face would be smaller, more feminine. Its a little larger than I expected for my petite wrist,  but since its not an &#34;everyday&#34; watch, it does the trick., This has changed a so-so watch into my go-to watch. The original black band was ok, but now the whole thing pops!, Yes, it's a cheap tool set but you get what you pay for.<br />Yes, it gets the job done and saved me about $50. for battery replacement fees.<br />This little kit was less than $10 and I used it to replace batteries in 6 watches and I've used the tools for minor repairs to a few other small items. It has come in handy on several occasions so it is well worth the cost. Glad I bought it., Amazing rose gold color. Very appealing to the eyes. Amazing movement.  Dead accurate & way better than MOST Swiss movements.  This is so close to Quartz accuracy.<br />I'm so impressed., Lovely watch! A lot of compliments when I wear it. Not a watch I would wear every day but makes a cute accessory to outfits when going out., My husband lol bed his new watch!  Made his birthday a happy one!, Runs fast, about a second or 2 per day, which I hear it wayyy faster than it should be., Watch fell apart after 2 weeks. Only wore 4 times. Seller would not resolve issue. Through the watch away., I did not purchase this watch for the need of keeping track of time, more so to have a black band around my wrist.  It fits the need as well as has the time if I ever need it!  Also, works for a decent price., The Armitron Men's 20/5048NVSVBN Day/Date Function Brown Croco-Grain Leather Strap Watch will not cause you to stand out in the crowd. Nor will it give you fancy extras like world time, multiple time zones, temperature, barometer, compass, etc. What it will give you is a smart looking watch with a nice Japanese movement and water resistance to 100 feet. You get all of this at a reasonable price.<br /><br />The watch face is easy to read with clear, large letters. The background is blue, but appears to be black when you hold the watch in certain ways depending on the light.<br /><br />This is a watch that can be worn any time to just about any place. It is formal enough to wear to nice occasions and inexpensive enough to wear everyday. All-in-all a decent watch at a reasonable price., many thanks, This is my third watch. Get the rubber watch band. Replacing the battery is nearly impossible and will essentially ruin the watch, but hey, it had a dead battery anyway. Keeps great time as long as the battery lasts, about one year for me., Very cheap cuality but what can i say you get what you pay for, because, surface of one half lose coller, shape, Very nice kit to have when you need it. While I don't spend a lot of time repairing watches, this kit has all I'll ever need to keep my watches going. Makes life easier when it's &#34;time&#34;,, Almost too small to be a men's watch, cheaply finished, and less appealing in person than in the pictures. Ended up returning it., This watch has a handsome brushed stainless steel band and case finish, with bright blue digits that display momentarily (to extend battery life) when the top right button is depressed-- just like the LED watches of yesteryear. My unit did not come with instructions, but it didn't take long to figure out. Mine *does* in fact display military (24 hour) time, or standard 12 hour time. This is toggled using the lower right button (after pressing the top one first) to cycle through Hour, Minute, Month, Day, Year, and then 12/24 time format. Note that the watch and band are not vertically symmetrical. The left side is curved, while the right side is straight. This may not be apparent from the pictures. I like it though, it adds some extra pizazz!, Awesome watch just what I said in the description you do have to read the manual, Excellent, Love this watch until  (both of the ones I've owned actually) have gone haywire. Although the watch claims to be water resistant up to 100m, this is certainly not the case. With one, I fell into the water kayaking and almost immediately condensation began to form under the glass and stayed there until eventually it just went completely black.  As for the other, condensation again formed under the glass (FROM SWEAT WHILE WORKING OUT) except this time just half the watch went dead...the upper portion is black and the lower is working.<br /><br />Needless to say &#34;fool me twice, shame on me&#34;<br /><br />Don't get dooped, this watch is a POS, tthank you, Looks better than the band that came with the watch., I love the watch, but the a face is plastic so it scratches easily and the finish on the strap is already starting to fray., Easy to install and works as promised. I used utube tutorials and took my time., I rated this watch one star because I've had it for less than a year and most of the black paint has come off and the seconds hand just popped off one day., Love it! It works exactly how it should. By this I mean it doesn't speed up or move to slow, it's right on time the way a watch is suppose to be., Purchase attention check,there is some nick on the watch...., Just received my watch today 8/24/15<br />I have to say I'm impressed for only looking at the picture and ordering and &#34; hopefully I like it and turns out fine &#34; ......... I have to say for a picky person  like myself, I love it. I do not regret buying this item.  SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!, I’m very impressed with this watch. I got the top model Invicta 9937 with Swiss movement in order to test if I can tolerate an automatic movement’s lack of precision compared with a top level quarts (I have a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Caliber-S). I have had it for a month now and besides its great looks, quality feel and impressive features for a watch this price (~450USD including import tax) it is extremely precise winning less than 1 sec a day. I have used it like you would with a sport watch cycling, swimming, normal work with the garden and everyday use and it just works as a charm. My original thought was if I like the mechanical movement I would replace it with a high end Tag Heuer, Omega or Breitling within a year or two, but I actually think I will stick with the Invicta now, providing it holds in the long run., I got this watch in both the Matte Pink and Rubberized Gray because I wasn't sure which color I would like best. I was looking for something neutral that would match most of my wardrobe and I settled on the pink. The gray was certianly neutral, but the color closely resembled cadavers (TMI flashback to anatomy lab) and that disturbed me. I thought the size of the watch face might look a little silly on me, but I really like it and am excited that I could potential use it into old age (Hello, presbyopia!).<br /><br />I needed to remove two links from the watch and was easily able to do it myself. I've removed links from watches before and this had to be the simplest one I've ever done. Awhile ago I &#34;invested&#34; ($5 on eBay...) in a watch repair kit. Mine is similar to [[ASIN:B000T9VK56 GGI International Watch Repair Tool Kit]] which still has way more tools than you need for this particular watch. In my picture are all the tools I used. Watch a youtube video and DIY! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT5tO_UTDYU&spfreload=10<br /><br />I haven't worn it out and about enough to notice a dirtying effect that other reviewers have mentioned, but I'll set an alert in my calendar to write an update after I've had a chance to expose it to more of the 'elements'. UPDATE: I've worn this watch off and on for the last four months. It is showing no signs of discoloration and there are really no dirty spots to speak of!, I purchased this watch for my husband to wear to work because I thought it would be durable and last for a while.  What a mistake.  He didn't get a chance to wear it out of the house, let a lone to work before it stopped working.  I just had to remind myself; you get what you pay for., Pleased!, My original watch band was worn out from use,  I had a sport one.  The band does come with two of the spring studs so I didn't need to save off my old ones.  I kept them anyway just in case I did happen to lose one.  No issues with quality, or wear.  I think it feels better than the old one did .. but it's probably because it's new., The band snapped off within 5 minutes of putting it on., This is a lovely watch, but it's heavy! Maybe I'm just used to lightweight &#34;rubber&#34; watches, but this has a definite heft to it.<br /><br />Also, I checked to make sure I'd ordered a *women's* watch because, holy cow, the bracelet is HUGE! I am not a tiny woman, and this watch needs probably three links removed. On a smaller gal, she probably couldn't lift her arm.<br /><br />This is called a &#34;boyfriend&#34; watch, so maybe it's supposed to look oversized. That, or some women have dinosaur bones.<br /><br />Overall,  I like it--I wanted a professional looking watch, not a fashion/costume jewelry piece. It's great-looking.<br /><br />The magnification over the date is awesome, and the face is easy to read. The night-glow is handy; all the points of the dial show, not just the hands/12/6.<br /><br />I'll wear it a while before I decide whether to have links removed,  or keep it in its &#34;boyfriend&#34; sizing., Nice replacement for my broken original leather band on my Expedition watch.  The blue nylon inside is comfy, and I wonder if it may hold up longer than the original all leather band., Misleading photo; this is not a grand seiko and not worth the price advertised at., The watch arrived with a dead battery. Cost me 20$ extra to get that replaced. It doesn't seem to be doing a great job at keeping time considering it's 5 minutes behind after less than a month of usage. I'm giving it 3 stars because I like the way it looks  so it's got that going for it., Awesome product, I have been wearing my LeexGroup Smart Watch for several weeks now.  There are some features in it that I really like and others that I still haven't figured out.  There were no instructions with the packaging so I was pretty much on my own in setting it up.  Thankfully I have a friend who has other Smart Watches and she helped me.  The battery lasts about 3 days for me, but I am not surprised because I tend to run batteries down quickly.  I has a silicone band which I liked at the beginning, but have noticed that I am getting blisters from wearing in and sweating so I have placed bandaids under it.  Two features that I use all the time are the pedometer and the sleep monitor.  I am giving this a 3 out of 5 rating because I like it but I think I could like it much more if I knew how to operate it better., As a dad of two girls, pink is BIG in my home. My eldest daughter is also HUGE into sports and has been wanting a sports watch like this for some time. This was the perfect size for her 11 year old wrist and still gave her room to grow into it as well. The watch has some great features including alarm, stopwatch, 12/24 hour option, light up face, water resistant, and the display was very easy to read. My daughter lovest playing with the stop watch to time herself in her running now too! The watch is well made and you can tell will stand up to a bit of a beating if it came to it, which is great for kids!<br /><br />* I received this product for review - all opinions are my own*, Among the most disappointing product I bought watches, Well made product exactly what I was looking for., Piece of crap, Looks cheap, This watch is awesome I want victorinox  from long time ago it is is perfect machine, In excelent condition. delivered as expected, Love it. The watch is a bit lighter colored in person, but is still beautiful., This watch arrived and looked awesome! The flashing light worked but no time would display. Tried to fix it and had no luck. Super disappointed I wasted my money on this!, Very pretty, but very large. At first I thought it was a mans watch because the face was so big. I probably wouldn't order this again. It does work well and I received it quickly., This is a very cool looking retro watch, with a little &#34;steampunk&#34; vibe.  It's a windup watch. No battery to change, you dont have to keep in moving to wind etc. But you do have to remember to wind it.<br /><br />I received many compliments on how cool this watch looked. In fact, it gather more attention than my everyday Invicta.<br /><br />For my &#34;senior&#34; eyes, I'd prefer slightly larger and more luminous hands. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.<br /><br />As &#34;wrist jewelry&#34; it is a great idea, it gets attention and looks expensive., Stylish, sturdy, and does what it's supposed to do!, Item arrived on time. I´m very happy!, After wearing it for the second time, the band broke. I had to glue it back together with crazy glue., It was slightly a small face but I'm getting used to it fast. Its a beautiful watch., It said boys watch in the description.....very misleading.  This is an adult watch., A good looking watch but is heavy on the wrist.  The crown operation seemed sloppy and I could not set the day hand on the chronograph.  Chronograph windows are very small to view without bringing the watch close to your face., Received as promised, I like the fact that there are a variety of timer functions on the watch. It's waterproof too so I can take it for swimming or water sports. Plus it has a pretty decent backlight too so the time is visible even during the dark., Hubby needed strong watch to wear to work without leather strap.  This is it.  It is performing like an expensive watch., It's an awesome gift for my mom, I bought this for my 13 year old son, he loves it., Gave this as a birthday gift, it went over VERY well!, As an amateur watch repairwoman, I would have appreciated some instructions as to how to use some of the tools. I'm sure that one of these is probably designed to open waterproof/scuba type watches, but I can't figure out how to use it. I don't know what the other strange instrument is for. I found the pry tool handy in opening the back of most normal watches, but the edge has already gotten chipped, so it must be soft metal. The other pry tool doesn't seem helpful at all. I purchased a large quantity of broken watches, most of them needing a battery. So, I hoped that this kit would help me with that task. I've been able to open quite a few, but there are still some that I have been unable to open the back of., Delivered in just a few days. Beautiful watch!, Good looking watch, My husband got it and he loves it, Well please with my purchase., Beware, this clock is only 16 inches in diameter not 18 inches in diameter. One star is for the erroneous description, not the clock itself. Returned., I bought this watch on a whim a few years ago and have kept it in rotation because it can be an everyday, workout and dress watch. The alarm function hasn't worked since I changed the battery (any suggestions are welcome), but that's a small thing. Bottom line, it's a great watch and the timer, stopwatch and dual time/DST functions are just what I need when traveling., Too short for a woman's watch. Now I have to get an extension, I ordered this watch.  I am disappointed because the time-marked bezel does not rotate.  It is fixed in position so it is mainly ornamental.  You cannot use it to to keep track of elapsed time., Crown came out after 1 week of wear. Looks way cheaper in person than it does in the photos. Save your time and money and go for a more reliable brand., I saw this watch on the Amazon home page and had to have it.  It is a classy looking watch.  I am very happy with my purchase, I purchased this as a gift.  I wasn't sure how the yellow face was going to look but I<br />Must say that it does catch your eye when my friend wears it. You don't see this color face on a watch often, and his favorite color is yellow, so he was very pleased with the watch. You just aren't expecting that flash of color, especially since most men's watches have a dark face. I think it looks nice and a little sporty. Plus Fossil makes great watches at great prices!, Awesome. Getting a lot of compliments., This was a birthday gift for my daughter. I thought it looked okay but she loved it. I didn't realize the middle links of the band are PLASTIC. I thought it made it look cheap. It comes in a very big size so it should fit just about any wrist. My daughter is on the small side so she had to have 4 links removed., The new band fell apart in one week. I was not impressed., Is it a Rolex?? No its just a piece of knock-off junk. Another attempt to look like the real thing. Be a man and get the real thing. This is so sad., I've had 4 links removed because of my small wrist but this watch is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be. I'm already receiving so many compliments., Love this watch! My battery stopped after only a few months, however. :(, This is the second one of these watches that I have bought.  On the first one, the strap broke after a year.  I hope this one hold up better.  Watch works well and is easy to use., Sent back, runs very large, even taking out links would not fit..., great.super!, Replacement for an identical older model, need to have the band shortened, which is not an easy task. Good watch overall. Update: Now the replacement watch has failed also and refuses to change to the correct time zone, so have to mentally subtract 3 hours from the displayed time. It's not a bad watch in design and function when working...just doesn't last long enough to make it worth while to keep replacing it every couple of years. Moving on to something more reliable, burned out on Casio!, It's a nice looking watch but I had to return it because the bracelet itself was too small for my dad's wrist., I am very disappointed in this Timex piece.  it loses time about 3-5 hours per day.  What a waste of my time. Now I have to go return it and get a refund.  I like the overall design...just a bad product.  Its a shame that Timex did not demand better quality control when sourcing this out for manufacture.  Also, the second hand does not line up to 12 noon!....pet peeve of mine.  Do not buy this product is my recommendation., Outstanding watch...exactly what I was looking for., When I bought this watch I didn't expect much, it was cheap so I just assumed it would be cheaply made.  It arrived long before Amazon estimated and in fantastic condition!  The watch both feels and looks nice, I couldn't be happier with my purchase., Love the way it looks. The date mechanism broke however in the first week., This is a very nice piece for the price you pay. At first I was a bit concerned that my buddies would think I bought it to pass it off as a Submariner and although they are similar its a watch to be proud of on its own. I am a project manager by trade for an industrial process contractor which takes me to some pretty unique jobsites at times. I bought this to retire my Tag as my daily wearer just due to the environments I will expose it to each day. I could not be happier with the purchase and hope you give this one a shot., I agree with a previous comment regarding the size of the band.  If I had seen that first I might not have purchased the watch.  I am also a woman and have the band on the last hole.  I purposely bought this one because it said it is a Unisex band.  That is misleading.  I have not had the watch very long, so can not report much about it except that it is a nice looking watch., I had to return it. The button to set the time and perform other functions was too sensitive and I could never get it it set up properly, never mind use it., My wrist was always empty. However, the clock went to the vacancy. Dandy as the best product., This chronograph watch is very handsome and affordable too!, Excellent, Didn't live up to the description once I saw it in person., Great Watch, Good Features but the Dial is quite small compared to the pictures and the LED's are very dim., My third and maybe favorite bulova. Glamorous blue tint on the face really shines. Will get you lots of compliments., This watch is a winner - can be dressy or casual.  Watch face is perfect - not too large, not too small.  The leather watch bands are easy to change and are thick enough to last and thin enough to wrap around a wrist comfortably.  I have a small wrist and have to use the last hole but it works fine., Band was broken out of box!!!, Exactly what I needed., For the money, this is a great wristwatch for outdoors. It has a canvas strap and Velcro for securing onto the wrist, one great feature is the strap itself. I have a large wrist which makes it difficult to find a watch band to fit but with the Forester no problem. For darkness it has a large button on the same side as the date window to illuminate the entire face for about 5 seconds then it goes off but with plenty of time to see the clock face. The downsides are the plastic housing (metal back) and the plastic lens, but for the price (15.00) with Prime - what the heck. Overall I am pleased with this watch and it does all that I would expect for a cheap, outside work watch. The biggest reason I gave 4 stars was the plastic lens., For years now my husband has been complaining that he doesn't have a good watch. To him, a &#34;good watch&#34; is one that is professional but still interesting to look at and conveys his sense of style. That doesn't seem like it would be hard to find, but I've been searching for years! This watch is perfect! It has a very clear face, a sophisticated band, and beautiful subdials. I thought that this was the PERFECT watch. However, when it showed up the face of the watch was A LOT bigger than I thought. I looked at the pictures provided but couldn't get a clear picture of how large the watch is. It wasn't until later that I noticed the dimensions in the description. I was very disappointed when I saw how large it was because it was actually too big for my husband. The wrist band fit and is adjustable, but the face is large to the point that it looks a bit goofy on his arm. Fortunately, I am going to give it to my dad who has make larger hands so it won't look as out of place. Still, it's a beautiful watch no matter what!, Casio G-Shock, This is the best watch I have ever bought if you look on the v channel you will see this at over £600 it's marvellous what this watch can do have bought 10 different ladies and gents watches of same brand, Did not work, The time was easy to set but had trouble with setting date., Great chronograph watch with an over sized dial and leather band of very good quality.<br />Also really like the minutes numbers on the dial and the small second dial.<br />Recommend to anyone who wants an all purpose watch to use for formal, work or sports. Especially the chronograph for keeping time when running and time between sets when lifting., ok, so far so good except you need 20/20 plus vision to read the tiny date window., I love my new watch, it is beautiful, well made top quality and just all around a exquisite watch.  Very happy with my purchase!, Comfortable and breathable. I love the color and the fact that it is waterproof. The band is slimmer than Women's IronMan watches that I have had in the past and it is very becoming., I bought three Invicta watches Looks nice but after a year the dials on the 6412 stopped working the 14381 gets water inside every time I am in the pool, for a diver's watch that is an issue :) the third one 6749 my dress watch stopped working all together after one and a half year, I used it tfew times, Way to big for my wrist, and don't like the watch enough to bother taking it to a jeweler to adjust it.  To me the watch seemed &#34;cheap&#34;, Love my watch!  Came i a timely fashion and battery was working fine., First - you have to be a large person as the watch diameter is 5.2 but also very high off your wrist.<br />It is a beautiful watch .<br />Note- to change the time -<br />Pull out the crown , turn it halfway and hold .<br />The watch does the rest., I really like this watch. My only complaint is that the date window is so small you can't tell what the date is at a glance, you have to really hold the watch up close to your face and even then you almost need a magnifying glass. Still, a gorgeous watch, and very handy to have the two time zones., you get what you pay for, Odd strap color. Not sure it's leather or even faux leather.. Returned because I had nothing to match strap, have used it and seems to work as said to., I love my watch. Water proof too. Had it for a little over a year. Still ticking. Got it from the Swatch store on Perimeter Mall., This is my review of the Swatch Sistem51 model SUTS402, Sistem Class, 2015.  The Sistem51 watch was released by Swatch in 2013 when they introduced the watch in four colorways.  The Sistem Class, which I picked up at a Swatch Store, is currently one of a dozen Sistem51 designs to choose from.<br /><br />Two models ship with leather straps and the remainder are outfitted with silicone straps.  The black silicone strap on the Sistem Class is accented with a blues buckle, keeper and stitching matching the blue case.  Case material, to include crystal and clear caseback, is plastic.  Fortunately I've not have the opportunity to scuff the crystal yet.  My experience with Swatch is the plastic crystals will scuff, however can be buffed out fairly easily.  The size of the case is 42 mm.  I find the light weight of this watch coupled with the soft-feel silicone strap provides a comfortable wear.<br /><br />Sistem51 watches are Swiss made, 19 jewel, mechanical, self-winding watches.  The 51 parts are assembled in a cleanroom by robotics and the watch case is then hermetically sealed.  The watch case cannot be opened and the watch cannot be serviced.  When I purchased my watch the paperwork was date stamped by Swatch which activated a 2-year manufactures warranty.  The water resistant rating is 3 bar or 30 meters, which equates to splash or rain resistance and not bathing or swimming from what I've read on watch WR ratings.  In addition to the time the watch displays the day of the month.  The Sistem Class’ black face with white characters is easy to read.  The lumes are limited to the minute and hour hands, lacking any dark environment illumination for the hour markers.  The white dots on the black bezel at the hour markers contributes to the look of the watch.<br /><br />The watch has a sweeping second hand as it’s a mechanical watch, unlike the the second hand tick of a quartz movement watch.  The second hand does not hack, meaning it won’t stop when the crown is pulled out to set the watch.  When going back in time during a setting, the second hand will stop and sometimes roll backward a couple of seconds before it begins to advance again.  The specks for this watch state a 90-hour power reserve.  I tend to only wear this watch on the weekends requiring winding and setting prior to wear.  I don't mind this, however if your not routinely wearing the watch you won't be able to grab and go each time you wear it.<br /><br />The Sistem51 collection really gets interesting when you view the movement through the clear caseback.  A majority of the visible parts are outfitted with graphic designs, which gives a nice visual when the rotor turns as the watch is moved.  This action is what winds the watch during wear.  The watch can also be wound manually when needed by turning the crown counterclockwise.  During wear in a quite environment you can hear the moving parts doing what they do.  I’ve found during daily wear I do not notice the sound of the rotor, only when it’s quite and I’m paying attention to it.<br /><br />Depending on your perception the price point may seem high for a plastic watch or low for an automatic.  I find the Sistem Class to be a cool looking, casual / sporty watch with an interesting story.  The black and blue design along with the watch face looks great in my opinion.  I don’t believe it goes out of its way to be an attention grabber unless you leave it face down on a table.<br /><br />I give the watch an overall rating of 5 stars., I liked this, but I ended up returning it. I wanted more of a boyfriend watch that was also matte. This is a very shiny silver watch with a smaller face. I ended up not liking how it looked on my wrist. I wanted something with a bigger face. I probably would have kept it if it were not so shiny., This OK!, Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend!, Fits our G shock.  My son changed his band all by himself.  Works very well., It's a nifty device. Unfortunately it's not compatible with iOS as it requires a Bluetooth app to install to your phone so you can access text messages and email. The Bluetooth works just for calls but certain numbers I select to make a call it pops up with a message saying unavailable. At times it doesn't want to scroll through my contacts easily usually bouncing back to the first name. When selecting the city I live it doesn't offer any cities in Texas for time zone so I had to choose Chicago. But for the price it isn't too bad bout as much use I'd find of an Apple watch. I rate it so low because of the compatibility to my iPhone., Tighter nesh than others I had previously ordered, hence a classier look.  Also liked how much lighter the band felt than others (hope this is not a sign of cheaper materials!, The watch isn't as durable as I thought. Barely dropped it once and the case came off., Worn it twice abd received several compliments it was a really good buy, Adequate, bought it when my other watch got lost. Found other watch when this was delivered. Use it sometimes anyhow. I wish the numbers were also luminous, and not just the hands... but that's a minor issue., I love this strap. Initially I thought it would hurt my wrist. This strap is though and rigid but it adapts to my measurement just fine. I totally recommend it, guys!, I bought this for my teenager son, he likes it too much that he uses it all days!, This is very attractive but I had to pay to have links removed for an improved fit., nice looking watch for the price... seems to be the &#34;gold version&#34; of the same watch (silver A168w-1)  not sure it's worth more than 2 times the price., this watch has a nice imitation businessman look, but has a serious problem.  Any time that it gets hit, or even bumped a little, it stops,  and if it gets bumped again (or if I intentionally ht it) it starts again.  So the watch may be running, but be three hours late.  Not a big problem when I am at the desk, but when I am active, or working with things, it stops a lot!, I received this watch as a gift. I liked it very much. It is very attractive and the functions all worked well. I had worn this watch while swimming in a chlorinated pool and it still worked fine. Cleaning the watch is easy because of the material it is made of. The reason this watch is receiving 3 stars is because I wore this watch to the beach the other day and some water got into the watch. The backside of the watch states that it water resistant up to 100 meters. I did not even go past 3 meters in the water, and also for not an extended period of time.<br /><br />I assume that this watch is not salt-water resistant. I would have repurchased, but I will instead look for a sturdier watch that is more water proof. It is a nice watch, and I am sad that it no longer works., Nice and looks fancy but I have some problem my wife wrist is little small and this is big wrist in size. I still need to fix the adjustment so she can wear.The quality is great and she love it so far.The price is not too bad.Grab yours too., The watch is beautiful, but it arrived with (I assume) a dead battery. It's not running. Will return it., Just a super beautiful watch!!, Fit and finish of a more expensive watch., works good, so far. the color seems a little diff than in person but still nice, My wife was very pleased with this band. Sizing was excellent on an old Timex. Very stylish., Not properly sized...  They work but you could strip a wind point...  Use at your own risk if you know what you are doing!, The watch was a birthday present for my wife and she likes it just fine.  Thank  You., On the advice of my daughters' urologist, we purchased this as a gentle reminder for her to go.<br /><br />While setting is straightforward, and the multiple alarms are nice, and the ability to lock the buttons so little hands don't mess things up...BUT, and this is a big BUT, if this thing gets the least bit wet, (ie. Kid-style hand washing) we have had this go dead a day later.<br /><br />We have been through 3 of them..but if they can remind her to go, it's money well spent, Ok quality, better stems to attach would be helpful., My wife is very happy with the watch, I got mine over a year ago and still totally love it. It works perfectly and looks so cool!, Love it! Looks classy and is appropriately sized for everyday wear.  Not too large and not too small. :), Love this watch so many compliments ! Nice watch and fictional.<br /><br />Pros , looks , build & design.<br /><br />Cons , gun metal shows oil smudges & watch band seems to light. Probably to help reduce weight of the watch, Very handsome watch! Works nicely. Lovely details on front with the train and the back is also very attractive.I  highly recommend this purchase. The company was quick to respond to my questions., Simple to use.  Love features Durable, Great little watch for the price.  Durable, comfortable to wear and reasonably easy to adjust.  I use it primarily as a travel and vacation watch so I can leave my better watches at home.  It is very useful to have the dual time function, especially when traveling abroad.  This is the second iteration of this watch that I have owned and recommended it highly., I got lots of compliments on the look of this watch, but the battery stopped after six months. For the price, I figured I would just buy another one, but when that one arrived it wasn't working at all. Get what you pay for, I suppose., I like it!  Easy to read the time without my reading glasses.  Seems well made.  Looks great., It's not high quality, so I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't disappointed. The &#34;fabric&#34; wristband is plasticized and hard, and the rough edges can hurt. The grommets that kept the holes open for putting the watch on fell off after just a few uses. However, it's a very usable watch, still runs great, keeps the time month after month, and I like it. If I knew anything about watches, I might try to change out the wristband, but until then, I will wear this watch until it dies on me!, I've had this watch for a while now with no problems and I break my G-Force bands every few months,  nothing but complements since I've had this watch, everyone thinks it's some expensive brand watch and it's nothing but chrome plastic inside lol.., Broke in a week, Cheap, tacky and awful looking! Nothing like the photo!!, 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼, Let me start off by saying this... This here watch... Ain't for the faint at heart. This watch is a high octane, testosterone boosting, pantie dropping, High out put, compressed piece of pure manliness. The only thing comperible is the next greatest thing...that is YOU... YES YOU!!! This watch was meant for a man like you! And if you ain't a man yet be prepared to become one upon arrival of this here time piece because when you put this bad mofo on. You will slip your boots on grab your axe and go out back and split wood for the furnace that you don't even have! And come back In and shovel down some meat and potatoes through that 2inch hole you call a throat! This watch is a great buy! I love the look the feel and the features! Stop procrastinating and cowboy up send the bartered gold and buy you one of these bad boys you won't regret it!!!, once i got it and open the box it didn't work at all,i had to send back to vestal watches and also pay the shipping for, Very satisfied! Beautiful and elegant watch. I had a problem in delivering the clock at the hotel. Readily Amazon did reset and sent me again. Thank you Amazon! I was a satisfied customer and now I'm even more! Once more, thank you, very sharp looking watch!  The leather strap is slightly stiffer than I had expected, but i'm hoping it will soften with time., It broke in two days. You get what you pay for., Cute!, Nice watch but the battery is kind of off right now. i bought another two in black which are kind of cool. i little lose on my wrist so i´ll see if i can change battery and tight a little the wrist., Swiss Legend Men's 10013-RG-11-BB World Timer Collection Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch<br /><br />Overview<br />This is an exquisite timepiece (watch) which you will proudly wear.  The price is absolutely phenomenal as the quality is impeccable.  The watch comes in a very nice case with a very practical instruction manual.  This is needed to truly understand the chronograph functions.<br /><br />The watch has the look and feel of more popular and more expensive watches.  It is a bit heavy, but that is what you expect from a high quality chronograph.<br /><br />The description indicates “rose” but unless I am color-blind, it is more like a light bronze.  The watch comes assembled for a large wrist.  Even though I am 6’3” I like a more snug fit, so I had to deal with removing a link or two.  The instructions say to clearly get an authorized dealer to complete the adjustment, however I am familiar with these types of watches and figured it was worth a gamble to Do It Myself.  I visited YouTube just to make sure I was comfortable in tinkering with this jewel.  I was able to complete the adjustment in less than 5 minutes – basically it’s pretty simple as long as you take your time.  One thing you will love is the final look is more of a fine piece of jewelry.  This is noticeable on the band as there is not a clamp which is typical on these types of watches.  The clamp (clasp) fold in both directions so you have a seamless bracelet and the look is very nice.<br /><br />Pros<br />• Outstanding craftsmanship<br />• Direction booklet is pretty straightforward<br />• Chronograph is easy to read.<br />• Has a very durable look.<br />• The clasp opens by pressing each side and as simple as this may appear, you will find it very practical.<br />• Comes with a 5 year Warranty.<br />• Looks outstanding on your wrist.<br /><br />Cons<br />Can be tricky if you are not use to Chronographs or these types of watches.  The adjustment is simple but many may need to consult a jeweler versus damaging the product.<br /><br />Summary<br />A great technological Chronograph which provides the type of quality you expect, at a fraction of the cost.  A very practical timepiece which is versatile to wear in a variety of settings; from dress to casual.<br /><br />P.S.  Since most may wish to have watch resized, I will be posting a simple video to help you out.  In the meantime YouTube has some great videos, not for this watch specifically, but the engineering is pretty much the same across manufacturers.[[ASIN:B003XOQFHM Swiss Legend Men's 10013-RG-11-BB World Timer Collection Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch]]need to consult a jeweler versus damaging the product.<br /><br />Summary<br />A great technological Chronograph which provides the type of quality you expect, at a fraction of the cost.

The second hand is the same color as the strap. If the strap gets dirty, just take it off the face and wash it. I gave this to my 11 year old granddaughter., Stopped keeping time after 2 weeks. Would always have to shake it every couple mins to keep it going even after winding it up, Item received was not genuine. Many discrepancies that shouldn't be., The watch is magnificent, it has a smooth sweeping hand, the chronograph is very precise and the design is astonishing. It's a must have for all watch enthusiasts., I wanted an alarm wristwatch I could set for appointments and because I can't hear high frequencies I bought a vibrating one. To my dismay it had an instruction sheet that unfolded to about 10 square feet with microscopic printing in 4 or 5 different languages. It also had five buttons that enabled you to program an immense array of complicated functions such as having it signal with different patterns for different applications although I could not really understand it.  However i was not able to figure out how to make it vibrate at a future time so it is worthless for the purpose I purchased it for., Just like my other watches. Lots of compliment for this watch., My brother bought me this watch as a graduation present. About a year later, I lost it while on vacation. I decided to try out another watch, but realized I liked this one much better, so I returned the other and bought this one again.<br /><br />Pros: This watch is very inexpensive for a quality watch. It is very lightweight to the point that I barely feel it on my wrist, and also quite durable. This makes it perfect for everyday use. It may not be the most luxurious looking watch but I think it has a nice modest yet bold look to it. It should be noted that the watch appears more jet black in person than this picture (which depicts the face as slightly brown). It is very easy to read and includes a slot to show the date, and will glow when you press in the crown, making it great for dark timekeeping as well.<br /><br />Cons: It can be a little tricky to change the date. The crown has to be halfway extended and it is easy to either push it in or pull it out all the way instead of stopping in between.<br /><br />Overall: This watch will only set you back a little over $20, but looks and feels like a much more expensive one. It will last you a long time, unless you lose yours like me., Really nice, looks exactly like the product but not as sturdy as I would've liked. Still glad I bought it. My friend loved it., Very nice case. These 8-slot cases are both very good for watch storage and a collector item in their own right. I have several and this blue/yellow is very striking., After less than one year the watch began to stop.  It wasn't the battery since I would get it running again. It kept good time when running. When I checked with Amazon  I discovered that the watch was covered by Wenger's 3 year guarantee and I would need to deal with them.  When I checked out Wenger's warranty repair procedures I discovered that I would have to pay for shipping and insurance both ways.  I decided it wasn't worth the cost., I'm on sail boats, working in the yard, hiking, etc and am rough on watches.  I have bought this model for the past 10 years and it's perfect for my lifestyle.  It has the features I need (water resistent, stop watch, alarm, light for face when needed) at a price that makes me comfortable wearing it in rough conditions., Perfect no problem my second one and it I received many complaints. A great buy, Nice watch,  I was afraid ithe band would be too small for my wrist after reading past reviews but it fit fine with room to spare. Love the illuminated dial. Good quick service, I love the size and look of this watch.  Had been looking for something bigger!, Item arrived on time. I'm very happy!, Just what I expected ., Super shiny but kinda really heavy the band doesn't do much the support the chronograph, Top service, This is a nice budget watch. The face looks good but it's very small. Maybe a little too small for most people. Everything is made of plastic but the watch doesn't look too cheap. Definitely does not look expensive either. Very minimalist, which is what I prefer.  Works with a wide range out of outfits. Doesn't make a loud ticking noise. If it runs out of battery I think it would be easier to just buy another watch at this price point.  If it wasn't for the tiny watch face size I'd give this watch 5 stars., I ordered I believe 3 sets.  I only got one set that is complete if I remember correctly.  I got three of the same color in one shipment.  What would I do with three of the same colors.  Although it was mentioned that you may get two of one color.  I am happy with the one with complete set but not the one with duplicate colors.  The good thing is these were very inexpensive watches because they were on sale.  I hope they last., The face on this watch is huge! Guys with slim wrists, beware, Excellent . Let's me know of my phone calls . My text messages with the name of the person which is amazing ., Does the job. This watch was a little smaller than I expected and the finish was duller., Handsome watch - It met my expectations, Can't say enough about this watch. Excellent quality and so far keeps very accurate time. I love the style and it appears to be a more expensive watch. The color of the face is very nice and easy to read., I'm biased - I'm a big Harley Davidson fan. This watch is absolutely gorgeous. Easy to read but (IMO) not gaudy and looks more expensive than it is. Blue is not a usual Harley color and it doesn't scream &#34;Harley groupie!&#34; to the world. Bulova is a solid, well known name and they make excellent lower to midrange price watches. Like I said - I'm a Harley guy but I highly recommend this watch., The watch looks very nice and my wife loved it, Great little watch that is perfect for my needs. It's simply a working watch that has a backlight for nighttime.<br /><br />The only downside was that I thought the strap would be a military style Olive Drab color but is actually much lighter than that. Luckily I had a black strap that I put on and am currently very happy with my purchase., Fantastic, regarding quality its ok but its way smaller than what i thought, i gave it to my 5 year old son..., This is an excellent watch. It can even be worn in the pool. I would certainly recommend it to others., [[VIDEOID:3e8511cf6f4ed6acf89368ecd73bd733]] This is a very attractive women's watch and it's full of the bells and whistles you'd expect on a digital time piece. Even the light works well. The buttons not only look good, they feel solid and are accurate.<br /><br />If you're looking for a watch for a teenager this would be a good choice. Great for an active lifestyle too.<br /><br />Highly recommended, Replacement for a similar Timex that I had for several years and the band broke (easier to just get a whole new watch). Bit clunkier than the previous one - but keeps good time and is easy to read. I am not an athlete so I don't need all of the fancy stopwatch functions. But it does the job., Excelent, Great quality - watch is more a child size. Amazon needs to list case size on product description., Couldn't find this item in store. Just what I needed!, Loved the watch and wore it every day until the second hand fell off less than two months into owning it. Not happy with the quality., I adore this cute watch, as well as the color.  The design of the band is rather cheap, but that can be changed., My husband loved this watch.  The face is larger than most & has to be adapted to.  Casual elegance is what it is., I am going to send these back for a refund. Two of the watches wouldn't stay closed and wouldn't stay on the wrist . Only the silver one works properly.  The watches  are nice with  a beautiful design and  bling and I would like them if they were not so big and heavy. I like my watches light weight and smaller than these watches. Even the larger face  watches I have are thinner and not so much bulk. I will have to get directions for returning merchandise.<br /><br />Annette L Wisniewski, bought it to my brother as a gift and after 6 months it stop from working.<br />why the guaranty do not replace it......?, Very pretty but broke in like a week. Not recommended, can't tell difference from my other expensive watches., This watch is big but it is so beautiful.  well it is way too big for my ladies wrist but I'm going to put it over a blouse and sweater cuff  to use up some space as soon as the weather gets cooler because it's just gorgeous.  I don't know why all these gorgeous watches are made for a man's wrist they should be made for a ladies as well. This watch is so beautiful I know most ladies would love it if it would come in a 40 mm size, Just as I expected!, It looks nice, but heck, it's impossible for this crap to display the time. Also, it's too tight on the wrist with no alternative solution., The digital portion is hard to read in any light condition.  It looks nice though., Amazing, Thanks, This is a very heavy watch with a very large face so if either or both of those things matter to you consider yourself properly warned.  I have bad vision so I like the face of my watch to be big with huge numbers set against a high contrast background.  This watch fills the prescription for my low vision needs., Cool, The watch stopped working within two weeks, I don't recomend it, An amazingly solid, cool time piece ., This is my fourth one, runs well, dependable, nice features. Analog face also with digital time, I often use digital date. Also has alarm, stopwatch, dual time zones, and illuminated dial. I work a lot outdoors in the weather and muck, and the watch band tends to wear out after about a year or so. My practice has been to buy a new one before the old wears out, and will wear the new one for meetings and nicer wear, while I continue to use the older worn watch for working outdoors, which extends the life for my usage, and works with the reasonable cost for a new one. Hope this model is still around late 2016 into 2017 when this one may need to be replaced., Pretty watch, gold catches the light as you move, nice weight, comfortable thin band...in other words, cool design.  But is it practical?  The glass in this purple is mostly smoky black, barely rosy as pictured, and dark, extremely dark! You need direct sunlight, your eyeball two inches in front of the dial, and just the right angle to tilt it over and over to see through the nearly opaque glass underneath to the hands.  As a bracelet it rocks.  As a watch, this is a designer fail in this color combo.  Indoor use is pretty impossible, as would be evening wear.  But, it looks pretty!, Cheap junk but if one needs a watch and wants it to &#34;kinda&#34; look like a Rolex Submariner then I suppose this is the watch for you. It's a sad thing when a watch company blatantly copies the style of another companies watch design. Legal or not, its just sad., poor quality, As advertised., I've always like this brand for their uniqueness and pricing but the metal on this watch has already faded to a baby blue in couple months.., Just what I needed., The face of this watch is very large. My husband has beefy wrists and it covers the top of his wrist. This is neither good nor bad for him, but if you feel it might get in your way, that is something to consider before purchase., Works as advertised, great features for the price. Onla gripe with this watch is that the face of it has an extreme propensity towards scratching. I've had the watch for about two months and I fear after a few more months the entire thing will both look hideous and be illegable. Good value though, fits nicely, looks sharp., POS watch. It doesn't keep proper time (or any time, for that matter), it fogs up when I put it on. All-in-all, a waste of money., A bit confusing., I own several invictas but this is definitely one of my favorites, This seems like a pretty nice watch for the price.  But the spring bars holding the strap to the case are very weak.  A few days after I purchased the watch, it fell off my wrist as I was putting on a jacket, and it hit the floor and the case was cosmetically damaged.  I decided to exchange it and try another one.  The next one flew off my wrist when I started my lawn mower, and it was damaged (one of the hands fell off).  I returned it for a refund.  I want a watch I can wear regularly without worrying about it falling off my wrist.<br /><br />Maybe you can buy stronger spring bars, but it could be that the holes in the case are not deep enough...not sure., returned, delete from list, Ehh doesn't fit right kind of a strange fitting watch, this clock looks nice the main disadvantage is all the clock and movement are made in china, I like it. It looks good. Let's just see how long it lasts (especially the strap)., Smaller than expected., Guys, it's supposed to be big and heavy. It's a 52mm watch. Don't blame the watch, blame yourself for not doing your research first. If you're not into big<br />bulky watches, anything over 46mm is going to be big. Stick with a 38-42mm case size watch and you won't be crying those crocodile tears...😣, Arrived fully solar charged and time set to my city. Paid for it to ship overnight and it was delivered as expected. It looks great on a slim hand and it stands out compared to other regular g-shocks. Worth the $128 spent on it. Haven't had a problem with the solar charge during this past week since receiving it. Have used it outdoors but never consciously tried charging it by facing the sun. This is my third g-shock and my first one that costs more than $50. Love the look and the feel of wearing it. Also like the world clock on it. The backlight is bluish green. The other features like moon, temperature, compass works but have not used it actively., I bought this in the hope that as a brand name watch it would live up to its waterproof billing. Alas I was wrong. THIS WATCH IS NOT WATERPROOF OR WATER RESISTANT. DO NOT BUY, Looks good, uncluttered face is attractive and easy to read, and the leather band is soft and comfortable.  Got just what I wanted and expected!, Exactly what I was looking for.  Accurate, reliable, and easy to read -- night or day.  It's light and comfortable.  The only way I could have been happier would have been for Luminox to bring back the discontinued yellow dial version of this watch., Very nice looking and functional time piece.  I get compliments on this watch on a regular basis.  The best part is that this time piece is an excellent value as well.  5 stars without a doubt., The first one I received had a faulty hinge that was bent. I returned the box. The replacement seems ok, and I must say is very quite, compared with the one I previously had.<br />Do not have high expectations because of the use of the word &#34;quality&#34;. This is box is hopefully value for money in the long run.<br />There are a few silly imperfections that could have been caught during manufacture.<br />Overall I am satisfied., Comfortable and soft. Working well on my Pebble Steel!!!. Was shipped and delivered within 2 days so very fast. Definitely would use this seller again., Looks very good, but the buttons turns green with sweat after a week of usage, ok, Such a beautiful watch very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />It was a gift to a friend looks just like the picture very happy with this, Got them with no problem and on time, Like it.  Sometimes it stops ticking and reboots.. Otherwise, excellent., too complicated to set, Poor quality and the band is not flexible., Awesome watch! If you like Casio brand watches, you will not be disappointed!, Love this watch. the band was a little big on my arm, because I have small arms. I took it to the watch shop and had two links removed. All my friends want to buy this watch now. It beautiful and it just glee on my arm., Excellent, Had a chip on one spot when I opened my package, Its loose and I cant figure out how to take some links out yet!, I bought a Timex® Men's EXPEDITION® Rugged Field SHOCK Analog Watch #T49261  for $36.98. I had a previous watch with the same model number for a decade and successfully used it snorkeling and diving to 100 ft on numerous occasions. The stem eventually corroded and fell off. I liked the leather wrist band although I had to replace it after a few years and the night light was quite helpful in reading the time at night. However, when I bought the new watch, I could not read the time as well either during the day or with the night light at night. Perhaps it is my advancing age, but I think the outline of the hands is not as bold as it used to be. When used with a white watch face, the luminous  white hands should be boldly outlined in black. For this reason, I subtract a star., Not real pleased with this purchase. The clock stops sometimes and it is hard to manage the different settings., I love this watch. I think I've had about 9 or so of them over the last 30 years. I keep buying them because they're so easy to use they have 3 alarms  and the Indiglo light works really well in illuminating the face at night. I will keep buying them when the next one wears out as long as they make them., just there, The watch stopped working after 32 days... And cannot even return back now. I would not expect 95 $ watch to breakdown..., Love this watch. It's simple, reliable, durable, and a good size, not too small not too big. Great watch if all you need is to keep time, The quality for the price make this watch a real value., A beautiful watch with a huge face that is very easy to read. The style is handsome and I would recommend it to anyone. It does not, however, have a date window which  always  comes in handy and would  have been a great feature., This is a huge and gorgeous watch. I wear it every day and get a lot of lookers and compliments. The band does lack quality, but has not broken as others have described although it is splitting it has not broken through. I do have callouses on my wrist and hand from wearing it. It took a bit to get used to, but it is part of me now., as advertised, So far I really like my watch band. It looks nice on my watch and fits my wrist perfectly. And it arrived early!, Viewing the watch at all angles before buying turned out to be exactly as it was I love Betsy Johnson and this was no different then all of her items thanx, Cheaply made product, but was expected., awesome watch, Junk watch had condensation inside case first day of use, Its ok, Amazon should advertise the size of the straps---regular, long, or x long.  The strap pictured looked long enough but wasn't.  I needed an long strap to fit my wrist.  After going over the different pages of watch straps available at Amazon, I took a change on the one purchased---not good.<br /><br />Saying that the strap is 18mm wide should have been tagged that it was regular also.  It was a wasted effort.<br /><br />Bottom line---I went elsewhere on the internet to buy the correct size band.  I am not saying that I will not buy other products from Amazon but this time around, I got burned., While the watch face is easy to read and just what I need, the band runs a bit small. It would have been given a 4 star rating had it fit better., I was very impressed at the quality and design of this watch.<br />It is a stylish and functional watch., Get lots of positive comments on this watch.  I have a fat wrist and this one was too big, but it was easy to have the jeweler adjust it to fit my wrist., HEAVY AND SOLID!!!!!!!!!!!WELL BUILT...I OWN MANY OF THEM IN DIFFERENT COLORS!!!!!!!!!!, Cool watch., Looked cheap...and the clasp was way to big for the band, Huge....impressive!!!  Positive comments everywhere I go.  This watch is massive and will turn heads.  Exactly as advertised.  It will not be my last Invicta I purchase., Just got this today for my girlfriend and its amazing brand new in box and even more beautiful than i thought it would be. Highly recomment it, I bought three Invicta watches Looks nice but after a year the dials on the 6412 stopped working the 14381 gets water inside every time I am in the pool, for a diver's watch that is an issue :) the third one 6749 my dress watch stopped working all together after one and a half year, I used it three times, classy watch., this product is above my expectations ! I received in the time expected!, My husband likes it very much., Excellent product. Sharp digital image. Quality materials and workmanship. Tactical design and color scheme., Excelente, Low profile and yes, its a G-Shock. Very impressive and it fits well in my wrist. Planning on collecting more soon., This watch is awesome for the price.  Google the model number and you will see many watch freaks talking about this watch.  The lume is bright, just doesn't last forever.  The watch is fairly accurate, I have timed it but it is well within specs.  The jubilee bracelet is a little cheap feeling when off the wrist, but put it on the wrist and it transforms into a comfortable bracelet that looks great.  There are some great after market bracelets on amazon that I might &#34;upgrade&#34; to one day but its really not needed., After 6 months of use the finish is starting to really show its age, some links needed some wd40 at first and have been fine since., works well, Just exactly what I was hoping for. Fits my small wrist perfectly. Runs good and very stylish, This is a great watch. My husband is totally blind so he depends on his watch. The only complaints he had was the band was a little tight. If it doesn't loosen up I can replace it. The other complaint he said was the voice. The voice says tirteen for 13 and tirty for 30. I guess if those are his only complaints, I give it 5 stars., I have ordered four of these casio watches and I love everyone of them., The cheapest (cost wise) watch in my collection but one of my favorites. Very modest and matches the interior in my Maserati. Expect anything less from Erica Caines ex-husband?, excellent value, Just got mine from the US guy. Very very please with the look of it., Great, functional watch. I work at a medical facility, so it looks a bit unprofessional when I'm constantly reaching into my pocket and looking at my phone to tell time. Especially when I'm inside a clinic. I wanted something that looks classy, was easy-to-read, and had a leather band. This watch fits all 3 criteria perfectly. I like that it wasn't too expensive, so if it gets scratched/damaged during everyday wear-and-tear, I won't be too sad about it. Only con is that it ticks very loudly. It's nothing I can't get used to though., as advertised, Excellent, this is my 3rd Seiko watch of this exact model that I have bought over the past 35 years. They are all three still working good. Just wanted a new one at this bargain price., pretty enough., I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase.  Within a week of receiving the product, the watch stopped working.  Although I was told I would receive a full refund when I tried to return it, which I haven't gotten as of yet, I was told to keep the watch and change the battery.  I changed the battery and the watch still does not work.  Don't waste your time or money on this product., bad quality and strange smile !  and dust inside !, My husband loves this watch ! Would definitely buy another !!, Watch arrived in excellent condition.  It is easy to read, even without my glasses!, Works as advertised., Junk - Rolex rip-off. Stop buying garbage. Get the real thing., This watch is very, VERY lightweight. The band isn't as sturdy as I was hoping given it is titanium but I guess if it was a thicker and heavier band, the cost of the watch would exponentially increase, hah. The face of the watch is very open and bright allowing the numbers to really pop which makes it easier to steal a quick glance at. This watch is great if you find yourself always readjusting your watch because it slid down too far onto your hand causing movement restriction as the light weight of the watch doesn't make the watch droop so far down so easily.<br /><br />The only con to this watch I'd say is with it being so light you almost forget you're wearing a watch!, Cheap Item. The watch broke after I wore it 2 times., I needed a battery for my car remote.  Buying a new remote runs about $150, so this was a much better alternative.  I also needed to buy a tiny screwdriver to open the case, but it worked!  Remote works great now., Confortable and beautiful. It went beyond my expectations, Watch is good but the second needle is hanging and rotating with the hand movement. I m not sure this problem is with particular my watch or for everyone., One of my favorite g-shocks., Very nice looking watch and well worth the price paid have bought two other men's of same brand will buy others when I see different designs, ok, Beautiful package watch for all occasion., i like it...my opinion, Beautiful watch with all the features that you expect from an Citizen Eco Drive watch.<br />I just think the strap should have a better quality because besides the blue side is leather the yellow side is plastic or synthetic. (Seems to be fragile or will degrade easily), I can easily recommend this product. No, it isn't among the top-of-the-line winders, far from it in fact, but it's been getting the job done for me.  I recently purchased 2 Hamilton automatic watches, and alternate between them every week, so the one that I'm not wearing on that given week will always be ready to go when the time comes to put it on. The 4 rotate/idle settings that this offers is an excellent feature, and one can also select whether it will rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or alternate. I've read that previous models had a blue light that couldn't be turned off, and I'm glad this one has the option to have it off. I really can't see why anyone would want it on other than purely for &#34;show.&#34;<br /><br />The motor is super-quiet, a huge plus if you keep it in your bedroom like I do. And I'm not sure if any other reviewer has touched upon this, but another very useful feature of this model is the cover, which keeps your watch dust-free. So all in all, a very nice winder that might not be the fanciest out there but gets the job done, for a lot less money than what others cost., This goes perfect with my moto360. I've been using this instead of the leather band since I've gotten it., Sold my house and car to get this bad boy. This watch so icy girls be skating on my rollie!!!!, I like the product so far, gracias complacido, I didn't know Timex made such a watch.  The numbers are easy to read, the hands are easy to see and the bracelet band is darling!!!!  My granddaughter is a very precocious 3 year old and wears it every day.  With the Timex brand, I know it will last and last.  A great price, too!, I absolutely love this watch. In fact, this is my second one. I also bought another one with black face and stainless steel band.<br />The front face of this watch is beautiful, it has two numbers, &#34;12&#34; and &#34;6&#34;, which are pretty big and very easy to read. And the FCB logo at the 9 o'clock position is a good highlight and it balances the Day/Date window that is on the 3 o'clock position. The two-toned color band makes the perfect match with the watch.<br />I also like it as an automatic movement watch instead of digital. Even thought it is not as accurate as digital watch but the mechanical ticking sound shows the time goes second by second, which is very cool. Actually, this automatic watch runs fairly accurate. It only goes a few seconds fast everyday. And I like the brand Seiko because they make excellent time pieces., The watch itself appears fine but I returned it as it was once again (i.e., along with what seems to be a universal fad) too thick, too heavy, too large.<br />Skagen watches seem to be the ONLY company with any sense of elegance - clean, thin, uncluttered, certainly durable watches.  The rest of the market seem to consist of sheep (pigs?) hungry for the &#34;manly, manly&#34; (?) appearance well calculated for the primitives increasingly making up the &#34;latest&#34;.  Quality is not really in question so much as style., Excellent!, It is a beautiful looking watch. My one issue with it is the hour hand seems slightly behind always so when it is on the hour it looks like it is still approaching the hour., Horrible turns black., This watch is great for the price. Fits really well, and the band feels like it will last a long time. I really like the gun metal look to it. It is shinny like the picture. Looks a lot better than the pictures show in my opinion. The functions are very basic but that's what i wanted for 14 bucks. the light works really well, and you can read the screen easily in daylight. Great watch. I have only had it for about a month so we will see how long it lasts., That's awesome, Very well built watch, many cool features!, This watch is pretty.  It fits my wrist better than my others.  I have a small wrist.  Wear it every day and it still looks new.  At first it was hard to read the time because it is black, but got used to it and no problem. Will order the same watch in brown soon.  The times are perfect and never needs batteries., This is a very nice watch for the price.  Like other reviewers stated it was more impressive in person than in the pictures on Amazon.  The case that it comes in is very well made and it appears to be genuine leather on the inside.  First impression of the watch is that it was smaller/narrower than I expected it to be...but that is actually a good thing as it is an excellent size for my girlfriend's smaller wrist.  The white parts of the band are made of ceramic and not plastic which is a nice touch.  The crystals that surround the watch give it a very nice classy look and not a cheap look that some low-end rhinestone watches put off.  In fact that was a big concern of mine when ordering this watch is that it would look cheap but in truth that is quite the opposite after seeing it in person.<br /><br />As with most watches you will likely need to take it to a jeweler to have the watch band fitted unless you have the tools and/or know how to fit a watch band.  Most places like kiosks in mall department stores are willing to do this for free or a very minimal cost.<br /><br />To top it off this watch comes with a limited lifetime warranty.  Time will tell how the watch holds up but all first impressions are excellent and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.  I felt like I got a great deal and it was an excellent gift., He loves it; I can't even see it-very small face., Awesome product, As described and authentic. Beautiful watch, perfect, Do not buy this item it is a just a piece os plastic trash does nothing. Very cheap., This is a beautiful watch with the stainless steel frame and blue dials.  I am a fan of Swiss Legend watches since the one I purchased from Amazon last year that looks great and is extremely accurate.  These watches use a swiss quartz movement which is usually battery powered, not movement/kinetic powered.  My other Swiss Legend watch uses a battery and I do not have to rewind it or reset it to keep it on time.  I prefer the battery powered to a kinetic because if you don't wear it for a few days, it still keeps time.  Also, the latches on the watch work perfectly.  The watch is easy to take off by just pressing on both sides of the band.  I have never had mine ever release accidentally.   These are large watches and fairly heavy so keep that in mind.  Other than that, they are excellent quality watches for a great price!, Cheap fake leather. The watch face has bubbles underneath the surface. Otherwise, it's a basic functional watch that needs time adjustment daily., I own two other skagen watches, both of which have very thin cases. I was attracted to this watch design looking at the pictures but once I received the watch, I noticed that the case was a lot thicker than my other 2 skagen watches, probably a couple of millimeters more. It was a deal breaker for me because even though I liked the color of the face and design, I didn't like how thick the case looked was from the side. It's also a big heavier so I returned it., I like it  My favor brand are Swiss army thank you, Excellent product !!, Fossil Makes Great Stuff. I love the size of this watch in regards to my wrist size, Tan leather band gives off a professional look, I can wear this with classy clothes or with daily clothes. I've gotten a lot of compliments., best mickey mouse watch i've owned to date for the money i paid., Smooth transaction & lovely gift. I personally appreciate this easy transaction. 5 Star from my side, A great watch for the money, solar, never needs batteries...  but, if you want to retain the water resistance you still need to bring it in for new gaskets. Warning! For those with sensitive skin the band does include a anti-bacterial coating!, Perfect!, very dressy looking, fits my wrist comfortably, excellent price - just what I was looking for!, You Basically Should Expect What You Paid For It To Reflect The Quality Of It But It Is Nice Looking Before It Wears Down But It Feels Cheap!, Cheap quality, only worked with my cheap watches, Solid links, comfortable to wear and improves the watch's looks. I use it on a Black Invicta Force 1517 to replace the &#34;Techno Fiber&#34; covered leather band.  Deployment is faster than the factory leather band and no sweat stains. The finish will wear off, but at nine bucks - I'll get a few.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FN00PM?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00, Purchased this for my husband for our anniversary and I had it engraved.  It is simply a beautiful time piece that looks really expensive.  When I gave it to him, he was cautiously like &#34;Whoa this is heavy how much did you spend?&#34;, but he can access my Amazon account, so he found out the true cost, so for the price, this is a great buy., Awesome product, Classy and sweet !, Easy to handle, does what it should do. Would buy it again., Big, bulky watch with a band that barely fits.  Uncomfortable to wear, but seems durable and was inexpensive.  Not what I thought I was getting., Perfect!, Ordered two of these and had to send both back because the second hand and analog part did not work , and the tag inside said it had been tested., solid consruction, This is an elegant looking watch that is easy to read.  It has an energy saving feature that keeps the correct time if you don't wear it every day to keep it wound., Just an all round quality build , like the leather , everything works fine but the lower right button only has one feature but other than that its cool, We saw a demonstration of these clocks, and they are extremely interesting to watch.  They are not a run of the mill clock with hourly chime.  There are various songs, and the parts to the clock brake apart to reveal further ornamentation.  Please note that what appears to be the stock photograph is actually upside down.  The parts that say 11 12 1 should actually be at the top and all parts spin around to form the clock fact, once hourly chime is complete., So, maybe I'm an old lady by doing this, but I love doing matchy-matchy.  Not so much with clothes, but I have this weird compulsion to have my watch match my handbag and/or my shoes.  I got a killer handbag from The Sak that is exactly this color.  Whether or not it's a style don't, it looks terrific together.<br /><br />I wear mostly jeans and accessories that are navy, turquoise, teal or lime.  This works with all of them.  The color is deep and I really like it.<br /><br />The price was great too. The last watch I bought was a nice Fossil in camel leather but I realized when it comes down to it, price isn't that much of a factor. I've given up on Fossil and would rather have something like this that I can replace in the Spring when I go for another handbag., Excellent watch. Fast Delivery. Product as described, Looks very nice but heavy and big comparing to other watches, Great buy for $17. The date dials dont work but I get lots of compliments. the straps are very easy to change. I dont find it heavy since I love the &#34;boyfriend&#34; look. Love bulky watches!!!, It's perfect!!!, Casio original with proper packaging and warranty.  Son loves it, but be aware that as others have stated the digital time display can be virtually unreadable under certain lighting conditions and the backlight does not really backlight the digital display., Bought this for my husband and he now owns maybe 4 Gshocks. This is by far his fave. It's not as flashy as his others but still looks cool, Best $5.67 watch I've ever owned!, wear it everyday, Just what I expected!! This is really a cool watch.  I love the black case and band.  The blue really sparkles contracted with the black.  I have larger wrists and the band is sung but not uncomfortable.  I often forget I'm wearing a watch.  I recommend this watch. RW, Absolutely Not the watch that is pictured, but none the less a beautiful watch.  Very similar in style but has noticeable differences., Worth of investment really descent watch, Very nice watch for the price. I had to remove 3 links for the watch band to fit right. Here is the link for the how to video if you need to remove links http://youtu.be/WuyRHCenVdA If you mess up you can buy replacement watch bands at meijer for $8. That's what happened to me but it turned out perfect. Indiglo works good too., awesome, This watch, even though is described as a men's watch, it's too small size for men. This style it's more for women, due to it's size itself and the size of the belt., Great watch. One year later, I wouldn't dive with it. It's pretty and fairly durable and very comfortable. I'm a big guy and it doesn't look too small or too big on my wrist. Goes good with almost any occasion., Very badly constructed. Would not close or fit together at closure.  Just very poor workmanship., Was beautiful  very elegant, I have many Invicta watches now and I really love this one.  I like the uniqueness of the movement, the fact that the face and hands glow in the dark.  Feels nice on the wrist.  I have another 52mm Pro Diver (Automatic with the open heart), so I knew it would be a comfortable watch to wear., excellant, Terrible watch.<br />The quality and make is just very cheap.<br /><br />Would not recommend this to anybody., As a Rolex watch, it is the best. You cannot go wrong with Rolex. But the dial color with the seaweed green lettering is a swing and a miss. Go with black dial and this watch is a masterpiece., Molding of the steel casing is poor, chronograph buttons are flimsy, glass cover over the dial is cloudy and has really poor viewing angles. In just the right light, it is a good looking watch. But I suppose you just have to hold it correctly..., excellent, The watch exemplifies excellence in watch making and design. The watch is beautiful. Classy...sporty and elegant at the same time. However if you require luminescence for telling the time at dark  this watch has none.  If you have only one watch for all occaisons...this should be it. I love this watch!, This is a lovely, small watch. But it is heavy, and I'm not enjoying it quite as much as I thought I would. The clasp is sometimes uncomfortable. But I am a sensitive person so other people might not even notice these things., Every person should look pretty., This has limited use.  The watch does not stay connected to my watch and could not access any messages.  Not happy with the purchase., Like others have stated, the indiglo does not completely cover the face of the watch. There is a dark spot on the top. I also tried setting the day &amp; date for the watch but ended up ripping out the crown of the watch. I'm giving it 3 stars simply because It's beautiful enough for everyday use, Something is wrong with this sale. First off, the owner couldn't have owned this watch for 30 years as this model came out in 2008. Secondly it is listed as a &#34;DeepSea&#34; model which it is not. Something is fishy., I bought this watch and does not include the certificate of authenticity of diamonds. Can you help me ?? thanks, Simple and usefull. It works fine with my iphone5! I do recommend!, Comfortable watch to wear and it looks nice, I like my pebble SO much more because of this band. The metal is a bit too shiny and I removed one of the pieces because I didn't find a use for it and didn't like the way it looked. Too my surprise, it was difficult to remove which supports the fact it's quality construction! Great upgrade on the pebble!, Five stars, too small, The watch is pretty and works well... however, the gold plated case is horrible. Actually all gold-plated case is tarnished with black color.. it looks like a piece of junk. So I had to polish with Silvo. After I polished it looks much better, but still it has some spots and stains... Do not buy a gold one!!, bueno, Pretty watches but quit working on the second day.  Hour hand wouldn't move and wouldn't keep time. I've purchased items from a bubble gum machine that lasted longer., Exquisite solid watch, Item given as a gift and was responded with very positive comments., Bought this for my daughter and she wears it all day!  I definitely recommend this watch and it's well made!, Fast shipping. Beautiful watch., I wished that hour hands were lighting in darkness, Dad love his watch, it's easy to read and that is what he needed., Very nice looking watch. That aside, the feel is very cheap when compared to equally priced 'invicta' watches (of which I've owned 3). The steel band is also a hair puller, ouch! Bought it as a lightning deal., Watch's band rippes after less than a week... Very flimsy... Nice watch but very bad quality, I have only had the watch for a few months, I tired to reset the date and the crown came completely off, now the watch is completly useless to me. To Invicta, it's to bad that your watches don't last as good as they look.<br />Singhed....Really Dissapointed., Looks good, but my daughter could not set it because there were no instructions! Also, the writing on the watch is tiny no matter what the photo shows!, This necklace was a bit smaller than I imagined it would be, but it is exactly as shown and quite beautiful! Perfect to wear for my &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; themed Bridal Shower coming up!, Not bad for the price.<br />Takes a little to figure out how to set the time because the instructions are limited.<br />Much lighter than my Invicta of the same size as this feels like aluminum.<br />LED's don't look that great in the light but are way better in the dark.<br />We'll see how long it lasts..., Beautiful cool and modern watch, very stylish easy to wear with a sport to casual look, highly recommended it, you won't be disappointed, Worth the cheap price--but then again you get what you pay for. Looks really nice and has even been mistaken for an Apple watch, but the silicon band got a tear after only the second wear. Not durable enough to be something you would wear everyday., Watch came on time easy instructions and works perfect.. Wow! And stylish a lot of compliments., This was a gift fort boyfriend and it's perfect. The last one I got from another seller had a broken clasp. This one has a real watch type mesh band it works perfect, This watch is a functional awesome machine.  The rubber watch band is a godsend for me because, I have severe metal allergies must be an autistic werewolf thing. ...joke... The watch is both big and heavy by most typical human standards so if you don't like a very big heavy watch then this is not the watch for you. Now I love a big watch and the weight that goes with it.  I don't want a watch so light I forget it is on my wrist.  Also I like a watch that has features large enough for me to see easily.  On those rare occasions when my eyes are doing well I can see the 24 hour clock embedded on the face of the watch.  The high contrast white on black face with a touch of red makes this watch easy to use and nice to look at.  Seeing the date in the bubble takes some training but it was not an issue. The watch appears durable and  having cerebral palsy means I'm not totally easy on any watch., Very cheaply made. It is very old and rusty., My daughter likes this.  Unfortunate that the band is so big.  She is an average sized 7 year old and has the band on the last hole.  It still is loose., beautiful watch, though very large.  fits well,comfortable.  date function is virtually invisible to me.  the topaz stones are beautiful and really make the watch stand out from the plain stainless ones.  it would be perfect if it were actually a sport watch instead of just a fashion watch., Bought this watch on my granddaughter's 13th birthday. She is a batman fan.<br />She loves this gift and is flaunting this watch in school. Other batman fan children were looking at her with envy.<br />The watch has luminous hour and minute hands. Probably, if the batman logo also glowed it would have been awesome., PERFECT!! This was JUST what I needed! No complaints!, This is an outstanding watch that keeps excellent time. As the old Timex ads said &#34;It takes a lickin and keeps on tickin&#34;. The watch is very sturdy without being clunky., This watch is not black (as pictured) it is actually a gunmetal grey.  In sunlight it is a medium gray color.  Nonetheless, it is a beautiful watch.  I wanted it to match my black titanium with gold inlay wedding band, not quite - but it comes close.  The watch is substantial and made of very high quality material.  The finish is nice and I love the size, as I have big hands., When I receive it , I found it amazing , I Like the color of iwatch band, A big disappointment. Had the watch just for about 2 1/2 months and the watch has been worn 4 times and is already changing colors. Didn't get any paperwork on it when I received the watch. That was not a cheap watch, so I wouldn't advise anybody to buy the watch because the don't want to stand behind their product., Band serves its purpose.<br />Looks relatively decent on my EcoDrive Dress watch.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the finish on the leather seems rather rough., Watch NFG.  Doesn't work, even with a new battery., looks better than picture actually, I ordered this watch for my husband because he does not own a gold watch...... I really like the detail and the face of the watch..... This watch is unique and I think he will enjoy it!, I have only had it for a few weeks but have worn it for a few surfing sessions.  the tide function is not going to be exact but it works well enough for surfing purposes and I like that it can tell the difference between spring and neap tides.  I only wear it on Friday's when I'm riding the motorcycle to work so I get about 30min of sun in the morning and 30min in afternoon.  Then maybe another 2hrs of sun on the weekend while surfing.  The rest of the time it is in my bedroom which has the shades closed so doesn't get any sunlight.  However, the battery indicator has always been on high., Great item!  The necklace has this little book that opens up and, inside, there is a watch.  My teenage daughter just loved this!  She wore it to school and her friends thought it was awesome.  Lots and lots of compliments.  They are all Death Note fans but, this is a very cool item even if you are not.  We are going to buy another one as a gift., My daughter has had this a couple of months and the gold color has not fade out.  She really loves it.  It is exactly like the picture.  The colors are very bright.  Very pretty., Great little kit, bought for my Pebble Time. However, I will likely use it for my other watches as well., We received the watch a few days ago and so far everything is working fine. The watch is simply stunning!, First week, large wrist had to remove some links si OT fits well. Lots of comments, big watch for a big person! Love it and the price!, Does not stick, The compression pin would not go in because there is a metal sleeve in its place. Once it was shoved out, the pin went in easily., Beautiful watch, just to thick and large for my wrist.  Had to send it back.  If you have larger wrists, it is a beautiful watch., Loved the look--gorgeous--bought for husband who didn't like winding it every day. had to return it, If you're looking to get your Seiko 5 Submariner tribute on, this is desktop diver you want. Great bezel with a sawtoothish edge, nice lume, dot & rectangle indexes, and Seiko 5 reliability. If you want a real dive watch sub-$200, check out the SKX007 or SRP307., What sieze dail/face?, Good quality and nice interesting pattern. Has help up very well. Highly recommended, Beautiful watch. Works great. Extremely quiet. Band is a little small, or tight on bigger wrists, but still fits. Love it., Powerfull watch for extreme conditions outdoor,  decent weight and band wide only for men. Not very accurate sensor but compass is good. Chrono direct access, multiband 6, 4 alarms, timer, world time, sunrise time, and solar power has made this watch a very attractive tool., Good product but it would be perfect if it had a soft bluest night light so one need not have to press the light button.  I bought 3 no-name brand from Ebay for $7.95 each that has what I wanted and it works fine.  The bluest light is not glaring at all during the night.  Still a good product though.  I gave it to my daughter for her new apartment., You get what you pay for. Product was full of scratches and very cheap material., It is very nice would buy another one if I need to, Very nice watch -- comfortable to wear. The pictures are not accurate.  The dial is not white with French Blue decoration, it is white with very dark blue (almost black) decorations which match the color of the watch case and the bracelet center links.  I like the color combination better that the colors in the pictures.  I got lucky!  You can not make a mistake by buying this watch.  Buy it before you lose the chance., i sooooooo want this thing, Cute, It's a very beautiful watch but as my close vision starts to fail it's harder to read without reading glasses., A lot of things included on the watch, and I am just learning how to use some of them, but so far the watch has been useful on several hikes.  Altitude and compus are new for me in a watch and they have been useful as I prepare for a major uphill climb., Easy to use but difficult to see! If you have less than perfect vision the fact may be a little dark for you. Lighted face only &#34;works&#34; in a dark room. Looks rugged and attractive, though., beautiful watch.<br />exactly as expected, Looks cool.  Does not look cheap at all.  It is very comfortable to wear and put, I didn't like it at all , to big., I never recieved this watch , i recieved a ladies gold watch. not happy !, Replaced one my son broke a few yrs ago!, Got it for my nephew, he liked it., Awesome product, Fast shipping. And it is exactly what I have been wanting., Cheap product.  Have to go online to review the instructions which I couldn't get the watch to comply with.  Couldn't get it to set., I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday.  The watch is defective. Condensation has built up under the crystal.  I Buy from Amazon partly for the ease of returns so I didn't read the return policy.  I should have.  It had to be returned within thirty days,apparently defective or not. I'm Now stuck with a defective watch that can't be returned. It's no longer the Amazon I've known and loved., My watch came with black plastic components on the sides. The Picture of the watch does not show black plastic components on the sides of the watch, it shows steel. However,  I did a SCUBA dive in the Atlantic Ocean two weeks ago off the coast of Wilmington, NC with this watch at a depth of 50 feet with no problems for 80 minutes.  The bezel is solid and the dial shows up well in the water.  The 50 mm dial isn't too big even for people with small wrists and fits easily over a dive suit.  I wouldn't want to wear this as an everyday watch but it's perfect for diving and monitoring how long you've been underwater, so you can monitor how long your air supply is lasting.  I would recommend this watch to anyone who didn't want to spend several hundred dollars on a dive watch strictly for the purposes of diving. This watch is very rugged and I look forward to using it again on future dives., A++++++, it's a good price for a swiss made watch, but it's very heavy and very thick watch it needs a very huge man to wear it.<br />for that i return it, Great watch overall!  The watch is a little bit on the heavy side, but is very classy.  My only complaint is that in some lighting situations there is not a lot of contrast between the hands and the background so seeing the time is not always that easy. However, I'm very pleased with it and would buy another one if I had to., I have mixed emotions about the watch. The first one they sent me came unceremoniously packaged in a zip-lock plastic bag and ran 7 minutes fast a day. Amazon replaced that watch and I had a new one within a couple of days; even before I had returned the first one. The replacement watch works great and keeps almost perfect time. (Incidentally, it arrived in a nice Seiko box, like you would expect from a department store).<br /><br />I bought the watch because I’ve been wearing one just like it that I got 40 years ago. To have that one cleaned and regulated however, would have cost more than the new watch. In essence, I really like the watch and all its’ features. The only thing I don’t like about it is that I can’t set the second hand. Pulling the stem out doesn’t stop it. On my old watch, and on the first (faulty) one they sent me, you could halt the second hand by putting back pressure on the crown (as if you were going to turn the hands backwards), and set the second hand that way. I can’t do that on the replacement watch. I just have to accept where it’s at. Consequently, I can expect this new watch to accurately and consistently indicate the same 21 seconds fast each day. If that won’t bother you, then I think you’ll like the watch. Assuming, that is, that you don’t get a lemon like the first one they sent me., The numbers are large and the light actually works well.  The Expedition is just as tough as the G-Shocks I have had in the past.<br />Personally, the larger screen is very beneficial for what I do., DO NOT BUY !<br />I have bought 3 of these bands from amazon over the last couple of years. Used the first one a few months ago it broke in less then a month.<br />I had already ordered a new one,That too broke in less then a month. Again another was ordered just in case. That last one broke in under a week now.<br />Looking at the container that I saved I realized the country it was made in China. More junk and paying good money for it.<br />Never again., Amazing!!!!!!!, I purchased this watch for my daughter's birthday and she adores it!! The face is a perfect size, not too large. Links had to be removed, but that was expected.<br /> Personally, I'm a gold tone person, but I think  the bling on the silver tone looks great., Ugly watch., My favorite watch., Excelente, Thanks, Exactly the size, shape, look, weight, features, etc. that I wanted. However, it ticks surprisingly loudly. While it is mostly inaudible over general ambient noise (HVAC, nearby conversations, quiet music) until it is held near your ear (resting head on hand is close enough) it is clearly audible across a quiet room, such as a bedroom when trying to sleep., Excellent quality, nice look, man's small wrist only, returned, delete from list, First off, if you're looking at purchasing an Invicta watch, know that the List Price is a completely arbitrary number designed to make you think you're getting a really good deal, &#34;Hey look, I can get this thousand dollar watch for only $130!&#34;. That being said, this watch appears to be worth the $130 price tag. Aesthetically, the watch seems really well made; the strap is of good quality, the stainless steel back is nicely etched, the case seems to be machined from a solid chunk steel, and the face employs a real piece of carbon fiber that gives off a nice 3D sheen. I am currently on my second sample though, the first sample had a defective tachometer which included an inability to reset back to the zero position. The first watch also had a chip of paint missing from the red spring at the bottom end of it. My second sample seems to work well, although I noticed the paint was also chipping off on the red springs which appears to be from the metal ends of the straps rubbing against them (I included an image of the chipped spring for reference). For me, any design that causes wear from normal usage is a design flaw. Also, you see the little red O-ring on the crown? You WILL lose that the first time you put it on. I lost mine twice on the first day but miraculously found it both times it fell off. I didn't put it back on a third time. The Tritnite glow in the dark dial glows a nice blue color, but it's barely visible, even after getting hours of light. I have not yet decided if I'll keep the watch or return it for a different one., Exellent :), Bought it for mu son and he likes it, a little heavy he said., Very bulky, and quite weighty.  Definitely a solid product.  Love the large, easy to read display.  Adjusting the size by removing links was not quite as easy as you would think, but with the right tools is not too difficult.<br />  The digital display is very easy to read in bright light, or direct sunlight.  In dim conditions it is almost impossible to see without using the built in light., I used to LOVE Timex, and in particular this watch.  I've owned three of them, this being my third. The others lasted for years and were indestructible.  The fit is great, it's not too big or bulky so I had planned to stick with this line of watches indefinitely.  I purchased this particular watch about a year ago when my previous Timex went missing.  However, I located the missing watch and this one stayed in its box until about 2 weeks ago.  To be very clear - THE WATCH IN QUESTION HAS BEEN WORN FOR TWO WEEKS.  IT HAS OTHERWISE SAT IN ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGING IN MY HOUSE.  In those two weeks, this watch has been on several runs, no water activities.  This Saturday, I went for my usual run but also waded in the river.  The watch is now useless - water leaked under the screen and it's now all fogged.  For a TRIATHALON training watch...ie, a sport that INCLUDES PROLONGED SWIMMING.... this is unacceptable and despicable.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH.  It is not worth it - I know that it's not expensive, but if you have to replace a watch every 2 weeks, suddenly $40 adds up.  It's a shame - Timex used to be a brand you can trust, but something has changed on the manufacturing side of things and this watch is worthless now.  And, lucky me, it's outside the return window, so I'm just out the money and I have no watch.  Don't make the same mistake - buy something else.<br /><br />Photo: 2 days later after sitting in a bag of rice - screen still totally fogged although the water is gone., Everything is as expected, This is a fantastic deal for the price.  I love the face and I love the soft beige band. It's thick band that started off stiff, but is now nice and soft.  I can tell it will last a long time., Excellent, The watch looks smaller in person than in the photos. With that exception the watch looks nice and functions well. I want to invest in a much nicer watch, but needed something inexpensive in the meantime. Considering it was going to be replaced I didn't see the point in investing too much in a temporary watch. This watch looks good, is inexpensive, and functionality is great., the watch is good but has some disadvantages, light weight more than required as cheap watches also the metallic band  need some luxury, When I received the watch, the box looked like it had been opened and taped shut. The watch did not work (nothing on the dial face) and the it even looked like the face had leaked as there was condensation inside the watch face. I returned it for a refund immediately., This is a very impressive timepiece. It came with a certificate of authenticity and I was able to register the product online. I have gotten a lot of compliments., I didn't like and have returned it already.<br /><br />I wanted something with class for daily use, especially in summer when there is a lot of sweating and I didn't want to ruin my Swatch or Invicta. This watch looks cheap and during sweaty times it itches the skin. Setting analog time is a pain and the backlight is hopeless. So, I neither found class nor functionality in this watch. You are better-off buying another non-Casio watch at same price or +-$5., Careful all the item I received was obviously an open boxed/returned item, but I'll keep it.  It looks good and that's about all it has going for the watch., Love my watches! Tools are okay. Must learn their purposes. Pin broke on the large blue utility piece. Still works for pin extraction as does the square, blue gig. Needle-nose pliers have good grip and spring open at rest. Various mini tools are a bit confusing. Now I need to order the black velvet work workplace mat. I regret not ordering the similar tool set with case. Still, one trip to the jeweler and it's paid for so no gripe here. I'm ready to buy more watches. Hey, what device works to remove the back of a square face battery cover&#62; Not found one to adapt to this job. Still learning... Craig, Best watch ever... Ive had this watch attached to my left arm for a year bearly have taken it off. This watch has done everything you can think of being through. 100ft of water 1000 times, submerged in snow frost 30 times, also banged on every corner on planet earth. Trust worthy to the max for the price. Still does everything it was made to do after I opened the box. Way to go armitron, ok, I purchased this watch in May and am having the same &#34;reset&#34; issue that other buyers have posted in reviews -- the watch randomly resets the date and time to 1/1/2010 00hr00, making it useless if you need an accurate timepiece.<br /><br />I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, but having used Casio watches for years, I didn't expect to have any problems.<br /><br />Based on the number of reports of the same problem in this particular watch model, you would think that Amazon and Casio might want to do the right thing and investigate, instead of continuing to sell a defective product., This watch is huge! For me personally, that makes it a little too showy; but if you like a watch with a big, conspicuous face, this is for you. Also please note that while anyone could wear the watch, it is designed especially for left-handed people. It looks like a high class watch and has a lot of helpful functionality. Even though its oversize look doesn't suit my taste and style, I'm giving it four stars because it's meant to look that way and I think it will please anyone who is comfortable with its size., Very awesome, I got them and they look okay - but didn't have any pins to install in the watch:(, I don't know. it didn't come., works well, It's much bigger than I thought it would be., returned, delete from list, Waaaayyy  too small for an adult. This is a child's watch.  Seriously. If you want a real watch,  do NOT buy this one., The thickness of the actual strap not the width but the thickness of the fibers are a little on the light and cheap side. I expected something more robust but for $14 what was I expecting., I bought one in 2013, but after 2 years it stopped working . The motors became more and more noisy then stopped. I called the company, but unfortunately I had no more guarantee. As I'm Canadian they told me to have it repaired in my city, Montreal. Up to now, I have found no one to repair it. I'm going to try another brand., This is hands down the best Seiko diver I have ever owned, and the second best dive watch I own, (sorry Seiko, my Submariner still holds first place). Firstly, this watch is very comfortable to wear. The titanium feels very light and smooth on the skin. You can almost forget you're wearing it. The face is very legible of course. The lume is bright and long lasting in typical Seiko fashion. This is my first Seiko with a hackable movement which is nice. I can stop the second hand for exact time setting. Of course I don't expect earth shattering accuracy from this automatic movement. I just want a watch that keeps on ticking, and Seiko really delivers here. As a big bold, good looking and very comfortable daily wearer, you would be very hard pressed to find a better watch. I really can't fault this watch., for the price I was very happy with the quality and the beauty of the watch. love it. very gothic and can be dressed up and down., returned, delete from list, Great work watch; tough; low profile (so it doesn't get ripped at so often) It is my second one; just got iot for back-up. First one is three and a half years old. Many scratches ion the plastic face, It is still easy to read., I truly beautiful watch. Looks like it is worth $200 and it just timeless retro. I great buy and an amazing find., Nice looking, but not working. Took to a watch shop in my office building and they said the battery is dead. Trying to figure out how to contact Amazon to have a new battery sent - shouldn't have to tack on an additional $15 for a new battery on a brand new product., Nice looking watch but WAY too small for me.  I ended up giving this one to my son, Nice watch as a female, I think it would be a bit small for a man's wrist. The strap has held up well, and it's your basic, dependable watch., Piece of junk. No instructions - couldn't set anything correctly. Waste of time & money., This watch is beautiful. Great quality. Also is gigantic. Bought it as a gift for my husband and he loved it. Don't know that is an everyday watch because it is so big, but it's a great one to add to my husband's collection.  I was hesitant to purchase because of the black (whatever they are) around the face, but I was very pleased that when the watch came, they were very light grey, not black, and don't take away or distract from how beautiful the face of the watch is. I'm posting a picture of it next to another of my husband's watches as a sizing comparison., Very cute and unique --  the description should have indicated for a very small adult wrist or for a child.  I had to give it away., I had been shopping for a good looking watch for ~$100 for a while and finally stumbled across this. Looks great and so far (after a few days) its been keeping great time. I was worried the size would be too big but it's the perfect size. Anything over 42mm is too big and this seems just right. The leather strap is good quality but I prefer a nato strap for comfort. I had been considering an automatic but I wear watches off and on so wanted to have something I didn't have to worry about re-setting the time or loosing seconds, so the quartz movement on this is great. Chrono works perfect--I like that you can track splits on it and the chrono minute marker is very easy to read so you can track total time. Details of the dial look very high quality, as does the polish on the side of the case.<br /><br />Update - three months later, still going strong. Looses about 10 seconds a month. My Citizen signature looses less, but it cost 7x more., My wife loves this watch, and relishes the thought of not having to purchase batteries. Excellent three year warranty, keeps perfect time, and at a very good price here, compared to other retailers. The packaging it comes in from Seiko is something one would find on a much more expensive watch., Nice watch, for 35 bucks. i have no trouble opening the front without the back opening. keeps decent time and I prefer a mechanical watch to battery operated. the chain is heavy but could be a few inches longer. taken care of I hope to get a few years out of it. rmember it's 35 bucks not a rolex., Beautiful watch just as pictured. Purchased for my frozen crazed nieces who I am sure are going to love them., I love it. Theres 5 alarms so I can give myself a bunch of alerts throughout the day.  The temperature and altitude came a little off but you can calibrate.  Compass works well. Real easy to figure out and super durable., I own 5 invicta watches. This is my second metal band invicta. I get lots of complements on its look. Yes it is heavy and unless your a really big guy links will have to be removed. Either way I love it and it's real easy to get use to the weight so don't let that be a deterrent., Bought as a gift, beautiful watch., I have had mine for about four years now, and it still looks amazing. Have had the batteries replaced three times so far. I regularly swim with it at the beach and at pools, going to depths up to 15 feet.. Got mine at Macy's for around $700, so I don't think I am ever going to buy another in-store again haha!! Amazon is amazing if they are able to sell it for $200, and I will surely be purchasing my next watch online!! Definitely outstanding value at this price point., Exactly as described. I have already used three gaskets replacing my own watch batteries and paying for all the gaskets and batteries with the first battery and gasket replacement. All additional replacement for my collection of my Sakgen watches are essentially free., On having opened the box, it had the bracelet separated from the rest of the clock, One was able to set all 3 functions by how for you pulled the stem out. Once for the day second for the date, finally for the time.<br />Not any more. You have to keep turning the dial twice around for each Day.<br />If the watch is set for Monday and the day you start is a Saturday then the dial has to be turned 10 times. Turning in the opposite direction does not work. Timex does not have the quality like it use to., Terrible. Arrived scratched. Came apart while rotating and my Rolex slid around. Certain to ruin my watch if continued use!, Beautiful timepiece, love all the detailing on it - the face, the band, everything. I only have two minor complaints, and one of them might resolve itself before long. First, the date window is so small as to be unusable. I've had Lasik surgery and my eyesight is better than 20/20, and I can't read the date. At all. Not even to set it. If you want a watch with the date displayed on the face, then you might want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Second, the band is fairly thick and quite stiff. I'm guessing that will work itself out over time, but it makes it nearly impossible to buckle - and literally impossible to buckle at the correct size for my arm., Watch looks nice.  Received compliments first day wearing it.  Functions well.  Thought the face was going to look too big on the wrist but is just right., Good looking. Has everything you need and more. Awesome to clear building Bc it doesn't glow stays dark., It's pretty and fashionable but the strap is so thin I fear it won't make it through the wear and tear of daily life for longer than a month. Dang., watch looks nice but is cheap.  The hands felt off after a month of use., Lovely birthday gift for my daughter! She couldn't have been more pleased, and I was very happy with my purchasing experience!  Arrived timely, packaged nicely and I would highly recommend!, Update:  You should be aware that while this is a Swiss design, it is manufactured in Asia, like nearly everything these days.  It's similar to an iPhone, which are famously &#34;designed in California, made in China.&#34;  If that matters to you (and it should), you might want to look for something else.  I haven't worn a watch in years.  Frankly, I don't need one and don't need to.  But, years ago, I read an article that when making a first impression, the first things people look at are your teeth, your shoes, and your watch.  My teeth are okay, shoes are always going to be dorky, so I figured maybe I should take the offer on this watch and at least be sure I had 1/3??  It looks much less blue in person, unless I received the wrong model.  Whatever the case, it is quite beautiful.  It's large, mens-style, which makes sense.  Keeps time flawlessly, which you'd expect.    The retail price is like $1000, which is frankly utterly insane.  Even if it were actually made in Switzerland, that would be nuts.  Shop around and wait around, and you should be able to get it for $200 at the most and maybe as little as $99.  I'm not sure what the deal with the mark-up is.  I guess this is technically considered &#34;jewelry,&#34; and that's how jewelry often works.  I don't know if I'd pay more than $100 for it, given where it's made, and we buy way too much stuff made off-shore anyway.  (I have nothing against China, but this practice is not helping them or us.)  If you can find it for a good price, you'll be happy.  It's fantastic quality, good-looking, keeps time perfectly., Just like the original., This watch is not for the faint of heart.  Nothing understated about it -- except for, perhaps, the gray color.  The face is huge -- covers pretty much the entire wrist, at least 2&#34; across, and is quite striking.  The strap is nice and appears to be decent quality leather.  The controls are on the left side of the face rather than the right -- don't know if that would be of some benefit to lefties.  For me it just seemed a little awkward.  What looks like a second hand is actually a stopwatch/timer.  There are two round dials on the lower half of the face. The little dial on the lower left functions as a second hand, making a full rotation every 60 seconds.  The little dial on the lower right rotates every thirty minutes.  Overall, this is an attractive watch with some unusual features.  You'll have no trouble seeing the dials!, slim, has all the pertinent  components, well made, Wonderful!, awesome watches.  beautiful and i get lots of compliments.  i want to order them in every color., It's okay I guess. I mean, I just use it as an everyday watch, but not to anything that requires me to dress up. I kinda have to wear it nearly everyday otherwise it'll stop on it's own...<br /><br />Kinda my fault anyway as this is my first mechanical watch and I'm used to watches going on and on by itself without having to move it around just to keep it going.<br /><br />I saw all the great reviews and bought it based on that. There's one born every minute..., another quality G-Shock watch - I got this for my 8 year old son - fits him perfectly and he loves the bright colours.My only complaint is that the light could be much MUCH better., Good for the price! Feels a little cheap compared to other high priced watches, but I've gotten used to it., Great watch. Maybe a little expensive for what it is. It's actually a real chronograph. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the 1/10 of a second dial does not center properly when reset. For a watch of this price I expected better quality., With the advent of &#34;smart&#34; watches (and &#34;smart&#34; everything else), I've come to a new appreciation of the analog world. I'm a technophile and considered buying an Apple Watch, but a &#34;real&#34; watch makes more sense to me, even though I depend on my iPhone. I don't want to become even more tethered to my phone!<br /><br />This Swiss Legend watch has a thoroughly classic look, and I've always been partial to a black watch face with white markings. As others have mentioned, some were surprised that this watch seems larger than normal, but one can easily see what it will look like before buying. Have a look at the fourth image above, which is pretty accurate in terms of how it will look on most guys. (Small or very thin men might want to look for a watch with a smaller face.) Although large, this is not the heaviest watch I've owned. The weight of this one seems just right and reminds me that it's not made as cheaply as my old Timex from Walmart. The natural tan watchband is very attractive and feels good (I'm not at all fond of metal bands). Although I'm right-handed, I also appreciate the fact that the adjustment crown and push buttons are on the left side, especially given the size of this watch and the main crown. In my experience, the crown can dig into the back of my hand when, say, leaning on a desk or otherwise bending my hand back. I don't find the placement of the crown inconvenient, and the push buttons feel natural in that position.<br /><br />Though this is by no means a Rolex, the feel and look of this watch suggests quality, especially given the price of less than $100. There are indeed many watches to choose from, and one's choice may well depend on numerous factors, perhaps style foremost. In my opinion, this watch is a winner in both function and looks. It's not extremely conservative, nor does it flash too many colors and gizmos. It seems just about right for almost any setting or situation., Very fashionable! Only 4 stars because the battery died a week after getting it., I actually bought and own the PMV65-2271 instead of 2272 as listed here. They are very much the same, JDM, U660 movement, Duratec MRK coating (some DLC element on 2272). The only different is the band and the slide bezel ruler. The watch actually wear much smaller than the dimensions I found on the internet. I own the Seiko Sumo so I'm used to seeing large watch on my wrist, I guess. The watch receive signal almost every night. Sometimes the weather is bad at night and the watch unable to receive any signal. However, receiving signal during daytime is not a problem at all. Truth to be told, the watch receive signal much better on a ceramic surface (table tops, sinks) than elsewhere. Really weird. My theory is that while surround by ceramic material, signal interference is less. One other thing I must mention is that the Duratec MRK is amazing! I baby all of my watches and all of them receive scratches. The exception is this one. The only scratches I can see are around the inside of the clasp, where metal meet metal. Otherwise, the watch look about the same as the day I received it some 2 months ago. No wonder this watch cost much more than similar watch with the same movement and case. I wonder if Citizen will put its latest Duratec coating, alpha, on this model in the future. Before Duratec alpha came out, MRK is the best that Citizen offered., I love the color of this watch (sort of like a wintergreen color that pops) and its simple functionality. What you get for the cost is pretty good in terms of value and it's a nice, stylish product. Includes your typical stopwatch/timer function and the ability to save several time zones if you're a jet setter of sorts., It's a very cute watch.  I trusted the Timex name an assumed it would arrive functional.  But...I was wrong. The backing doesn't fit the watch. It was held in place by the removable band, so it kept stopping because the battery kept getting loose. I can't get the backing on. it just doesn't fit.  I threw away the packaging, so I can't even return it. What a waste. Not sure if this is a problem for Timex or a problem for the seller.  NEVER going to use this service again., This is an amazingly good watch - in fact, this is my second one, replacing the first which rapidly became my &#34;most-days watch&#34; for a year and a half.  Unfortunately, I managed to somehow tear mine off after sailing a few weeks ago (it's plenty waterproof if you're not diving), and after debating buying a different watch, decided to buy an exact duplicate of the one I lost.  (If anyone finds one of these near the Austin YC ramp, I'd love to have it back...)  The fact that I bought one again says it all, but read on for the details of why.<br /><br />I love everything about this watch:  The size (not too big/thick/heavy, like many current watches), the clean understated simplicity of the design (at less than 2% of the cost of a Bremont Solo), the band (I wish I could buy this exact band as a replacement - I was looking for a replacement but hadn't found one yet when I lost mine), the color, the face, the timekeeping, the day/date, the more comfortable  4-o'clock location of the crown, and the cool glass back to see the inner workings.  The stamping finish on the movement is the one of the only three things that sort-of tip off the lower price of this watch.  (Interestingly, the finish on my new one is now much better than it was on my previous one, so apparently this bugged somebody at Seiko, too.  But I'm an engineer, and nitpicky about this stuff...)  The second thing is that the luminous material on the hands and face could stand to be a bit better, and the last is that the Hardlex crystal is pretty tough, but obviously, at this price point, not sapphire.  I don't baby my watches - in fact, I tend to (inadvertently) beat the tar out of them, and this watch has proved to be quite good at handling real life.<br /><br />The Seiko 5's have a very nice automatic-winding movement (no batteries!), and my previous one kept ridiculously good time - after settling in for a few months (I wouldn't recommend adjusting the timekeeping until after that even if you're the sort who tends to tweak watches), it was keeping time almost as well as a quartz watch or at least, a COSC chronometer - under 2 seconds a day! (I realize my new one is unlikely to be quite that good, but I can hope...)  Seiko does not sell the 5 in the US, but buying it through Amazon gives you a valid US warranty - not that you're likely to need it.  Seiko has always been known for great-quality mid-range and high-end watches (both quartz and mechanical), but the Seiko 5 series is proof that even their low-end mechanical watches are of extremely high quality.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.sort who tends to tweak watches), it was keeping time almost as well as a quartz watch or at least, a COSC chronometer - under 2 seconds a day!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED., I like it, just the tick sound is real loud when quiet., Fast shipping! I am very pleased with the seller and the item! Thank you!, I get compliments on this all the time., Nice looking watch,  not too heavy.<br />Temperature  off by 1c  guess with body heat.<br />Bezel feel kinda cheap., After seeing how this works on face book, it only took a few minutes to  press the back onto my wife's watch., Terrible watches, I mean they look nice but when I received them, one did NOT work and the other one was way too fast., TOO SMALL!!!, Loved it.  Quick shipment, just like pics.  Everyone thinks it's über expensive and wants one too, Excellent, I'm really happy with this Seiko watch.  I own more expensive watches automatic watches (Cartier, Rolex, Tag Heuer) and I feel the quality and look of this watch is right there with my more expensive watches.  I did some research and settled on this watch because the look and style reminds me of my Omega Seamaster.  I think this watch is ideal for someone who wants a quality watch for day to day wear without having to worry about watch damage and wear and tear.  It's yet to be seen how this watch will fair over the upcoming years but so far this is just what I was looking for at a great price point., this is one of my wife's favorite pieced to wear. the polish is starting to wear off so tha copper is showing through, but that is ok. its been loved, Not bad, Battery went dead in a day but its a cute watch., Looked cheap, you could see glue on the sides., Item arrived on time. I´m very happy!, The watch looks very nice. The surface is easily readable and the blue color/style give the watch a truly elegant look.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is with the spoke that holds the band to the watch face. After about a week of normal wear, the band snapped off. The spoke that holds the band to the watch has been warped to the point of replacement.<br /><br />All in all, I like this watch. I only wish it came with a stronger spoke., A neat novelty, fairly cheap quality, This is described as a boy's watch, but it really made more for adults as it is very large., Returned, The watch looks amazing, elegant and big in the same time. The quality it's beyond it's price., I've owned other La Mer watches and love the wrap-around style. The Soho collection watches wrap around 3 times rather than 2 (and so, the picture isn't accurate since that shows the traditional double wrap style). I just got the watch and it's a bit stiffer than I expected, but since it's suede, I'm thinking it'll loosen up quickly. I have tiny wrists and wear it on the 2nd-to-tightest hole (normally with La Mer I have to wear it on the tightest one). Really cool style and I'm excited to wear it!, Nike WG58-4000 watch band from 2007 is no longer available so I purchased this as a substitute. With  little triming of the band it all worked perfect!, its ok, Just what we needed for my husband's watch.  I had to cut the sides to fit his watch, but it was easy and works well.  It is a great value for replacing a broken watch band!, I love my Swatch! Reliable timepiece that's also really cute and fun to wear. I love the long double strap and silicone material - very comfortable and it's water resistant, so it's great to wear during sports or other activities where it might get wet., I got this watch about 10 years ago from a jeweler that would hook me up with custum items. His brother would design and fabricate jewelry. Anyway they had a couple of these watches on display and they had just hooked me up with a chain and custum made charm and I bought this watch to match. I got to say is been one of the greatest purchases I have ever made. I still wear the watch once and a while but I will be passing it on to my newborn son when he is of age. This watch and the chain  are both official. I've gotten so many compliments on this watch. I recommend it., looks awesome, Nice watch. It looked a lot smaller in the pictures lol, Sizing and quality of the watch strap was perfect and came as advertised. I would recommend JP Leatherworks for any watch replacement part needs. Added bonus, It arrived a week earlier with standard shipping... Giddy up!, Superficially pretty but cheaply made and cheap-looking.  Is already losing time.  OK for a kid or young teen, but not up to most standards otherwise., This is an awesome piece at a great price, my wife requested this item for our up coming 12th anniversary...<br />I took a chance and looked up the Michael Kors model number and thanks to Discount Watches I have saved lots of money and my wife will be a happy camper!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Rubes Gandhi, luxury watches, I am satisfied, Very cute watch! The color is exactly what you see. The band it glittery and the blinking light works perfectly. I'm fully expecting my niece to love it, This watch is massive!!!! Looks of normal size on the image, but looks ridiculous in person., Just a cheap watch. Wish the item description had been truthful. Watch is not stainless just painted base metal or plastic. The pushers and subdials are faux. It does tell time though. Looks cool., ok, The delivered item is not same as in the picture, A+++++++, responsable, When i was a boy, i remember discovering the magnificent color scheme of grey, orange, silver, and black. My visits to a dive shop exposed me to high end watches that were beyond my price range at the time, and they were not as compelling as the 40/8300ORG. It stopped me in my tracks! For a watch to have 5ATM or 330ft at this price range, plus a fader after hitting the light button, plus a very comfortable wrist design i'm really surprised by these qualities., Watch sucks, Purposely bought this for its supposed luminosity. It is not viewable at night., This a nifty watch!  It truly adjusts to atomic time so you never need to set the time or the date!  It truly never needs a batter because it's solar powered.  The band was the easiest ever to change size. The watch looks really nice on the arm and the all stainless steel and waterproof makes it a worry free, always right, last forever good looking where everywhere watch.  That's perfection!, This is a &#34;clean/smart&#34; looking watch. I was a bit put off at first at the size of the face, I tend to favor smaller watch faces. However it looks good on and feels nice too. The band seems to be quality built, stitching looks nice. I really like this watch, Owsome style, light and simple!, Broke not long after I started wearing it. Looks cool., couldn't get links to make it fit my wrist. Casio wanted to sell me a whole band at almost the cost of the watch., It says the clock is waterproof, but it is not! The day counter is worthless, Very elegant and stylish, Awesome watch!, is amazing, This is my second of these watches in a 6 month period. My daughter bought one for me Xmas 2014. I loved it and never got so many compliments on a watch. 6 months to the day, both of the straps that hold the wrist band down popped off. A week later, in the shower, the watch EXPLODED off of my wrist. The back flew off and out popped the entire mechanism.<br /><br />Understand, I loved this watch. My daughter gave it to me. So, I bought a replacement. Approx. one month later, both the bands that hold the wrist band down have popped off.<br /><br />it's a beautiful watch. But SHODDY craftsmanship. I'd give it zero stars if I could., Perfect....note height of body is a bit tall...gives a slight feminine look. Pic does not show this, I've worn this almost daily for three years during my day job, hiking, running, working in the garden, 5 Everest expeditions and while snorkeling with rabid barracudas in Bali.  It still looks great and cleans up good as new.  If I ever lost this watch, I'd probably cry, beat my head against a wall, then immediately purchase another., Excellent. Very classy and simple. My Husband loves it., beautiful., Nice quality strap. No issues what so ever. Feels like a 40 dollar strap., Hit it timely but it stop working within a week., No good water go in side I don't like it I want change, It's so easy to use. Now I never have to worry about going to the jeweller to have my watches sized!, Looks larger in the picture than what I received.  Picture does not show it was tapered, which made the band too small for my wrist. I don't measure everything, I just went by the picture., Terrible !! Didn't stay on my wrist more then a minute! ! Lock is very CHEAP !!, This is such a beautiful and simple watch., Watch arrived as pictured but was obviously made of inferior components.  The rotating bezel has no detent to keep it from turning inadvertantly and the second hand fell off after about two weeks.  Apparently there is no procedure to return it if over 30 days.  I would probably NOT buy one of these., At first a little hard to learn but I am satisfied with the watch., Yup ~ it works!, Absolutely love it! I've had it for 2 years, never changed the battery, take it swimming all the time., This is a good looking watch. It has done well in getting wet and overall &#34;toughness&#34;. The biggest issue is that it is HEAVY. Not just a little heavy but really heavy. My husband has a hard time finding a watch big enough to go around his wrist and we were happy this fit perfectly without having to add extra links in but he commented on the weight. It's 3 times as heavy as his normal Citizen watch. It he were a skinny armed guy, this thing would weigh him down LOL. Other than that, it's a great watch, Very pretty watch.  Just the right size.  Not too large or too small.  I really like Anne Klein watches., Did not work., I like it a lot.  This is a solid and practical timepiece. The only frill is it tells you the date.  Perhaps not noted by others, the crystal is slightly recessed below the level of the case, which helps protect the crystal.  Also, it does not have pins holding the band on - it is solid metal.The band is a bit stiff, but it also dries quickly and you can just rise it if it gets sweaty or soiled, though nothing seems to show on it.I like the way the set screw is inset and offset.  Note that the setting screw screws down tight, and you gave to remember to do that after setting the time to make the watch water resistant.  Otherwise water will get into the case.  Warnings to this effect come with the product.  Oh yes, it also keeps good time.  I also like that there are a lot of other bands you can get for this watch if you want to change things up., Buy these watches to be sent to Nicaragua . Just you have 10 days to use and have turned black ! 100% garbaje, The back of the watch came loose and has a tendency to slip off, Nice solid leather strap watch with a rugged look., Met my expectations., I like this watch.  I've owned 3 over the last several years.  The battery or watch dies in about 2 yrs and it does not do well in pool water despite being &#34;water resistant&#34;, but it's cheap and I like the design of the face, so I keep buying it.  I was surprised to see Liam Neeson wearing the same model in the movie Nonstop.  I suppose Liam heard that I wear the same watch and just had to have one.  Can't blame him really., This watch is cool and stylish and for that price is even better. Highly recommend to anyone to buy this, it is simply an amazing watch!!, I was able to easily setup this great watch. I wanted one that was easy to see and looked good.<br />It is not a small device but it doesn't look too big either. The indiglo feature is also a plus.<br />I am pleased with the look and function of the watch, I would not hesitate to recommend it., Purchased this as a replacement to my last 'work' watch.  Durable enough for when I am doing yard work or working in the garage.  The band is quite stiff, but will most likely loosen up after some use., Awesome watch. Can switch from military time and back. Can actually read the day and date, Too big for my small.wrist, Was pleased to find this and it seems like a nice quality item but it's too short to buckle securely around my wife's wrist! Didn't expect that - had to return it., The band size adjuster flew apart the first time I took it out of the box and tried to adjust it.<br /><br />So far, they've been good about the return, but I had to pay for the shipping out of my own pocket., 👌, This watch band is NOT &#34;one size fits all&#34;! My wife has a Walton watch. She bought it at CVS so it's not an expensive watch. She loves this watch and has owned several of this same exact watch over the years. I had to &#34;snip and clip&#34; the band because it was to wide to fit the watch opening. The pins that came with the new band were to long but fortunately I was able to use the old pins. Bottom line is I made this band work but again it is NOT &#34;one size fits&#34; all., My husband bought this for me as a Valentine's gift two years ago. I love it. I wear it everyday and only take it off to shower. I have received many compliments on it from many different people.  All the &#34;diamonds&#34; are still intact, the color is still gold, and the inside of the band is smooth and not one bit rough which tends to happen with cheap watches. Obviously I never have to change the battery and the occasional water to it has not affected it at all.  The only problem I have with it, is being an active person the watch tends to be fast as I am moving a lot. I would buy a second watch in a heartbeat if something happened to the first. Very impressed. :), These casio watches are very nice. You notice that watch was plural because I have bought four of them and I love all of them., Beautiful case, Great Watch So Far Distinctive Face And Came quickly 2 day shipping ..Really Fine looking watch without a huge face, Quite Classy ,Love the day on top Feature ...all In  all Highly Recommended!, Awesome, This is basically a Citizen movement in a generic case. I have the exact same watch inan Invicta. It is a modified Citizen Campanola movement. Bulova has the exactly same watch also called a precissionist., The world time zone map is too small to read properly. The SEARCH button can be pressed accidentally if the watch is pressed against the back of your hand, which happens quite often. Every time I look at the watch to see the time, I have to press the SEARCH button multiple times to get back to the current time zone. It would've been better if the MODE and the SEARCH buttons were swapped., Absolutely perfect watch. I really am enjoying it. The atomic feature makes it truly maintenance free., Well built watch. Arrived in good time considering distance travel.  This is a large watch bear that in mind if your are thinking of buying one, Excellent!  My 6 year old grandson loved this!  His Mom was thrilled with how fast and easy he learned to tell time!  He announces the time all day long!  Great watch!, Cute watch.  I'm not used to this type of band, so it took some getting used to., This is hands down the best watch quality to price ratio I've ever seen. It keeps time perfectly, the stop watch works incredibly well, and is frighteningly precise. I also think it's gorgeous. If I had to come up with anything negative, all I can think of is it's a bit heavy. If I could add any custom feature it would be luminox style crystals to read it a little better at night. Other than that, it's my favorite watch in my collection., this is the best watch i have ever owned.  I had one just like this one and it got broken and I saw this one and I ordered it quickly.  Now I have my watch back.  Great watch!!, My grandson selected it. He was very dissappointed in it when it arrived., 👌, I bought this for my pre ship checklist for Marine Corps OCS. It was the recommended watch, not bad. get what you pay for, Very nice watch. Dial is still very small for this type of watch, but still easy to read, and looks good on small wrists. Entire watch face is luminous (hands are dark), which is a different twist. Watch band was not very easy to remove links from; pin holes seemed smaller than usual, and required a very fine driver to knock out., Got these for my daughter who is a fan of Full Metal Alchemist, she is very pleased with them. We received both the silver and the black pocket watch. Shipping was extremely fast, and they came packaged in a small jewelry box separated by foam. The quality to detail on the watches, makes up for the cheaper material. My daughter definitely recommends them for any fan of the show.<br /><br />* I received the item at discount in exchange for my honest review. *, Good replacement strap. Kind of a tight fit on a Casio classic, but it can be done with a little patience. Having the extra layer between watch and wrist, and the extra folded back takes a little getting used to, but it works well for exercise, which is what I use it for. Excellent customer service., Just need batteries, My grandson loves it...he is 8 and his face exploded with joy. Great product. He wears it swimming and showering.  The only downside is that when his parents tell him he can read for 15 more minutes. .he sets the timer and if they come tell him times up...he shows them..nope...3 more minutes on my watch. (-:, It can stand to be loner in lenght, This watch is not a annual watch! Misleading the customer ! Never buy Timex watch again !!!!!!!!, The one I purchased quite after only 9 months.  Previous to this I had a gold Timex which lasted about 10 years.  It appears the battery connection was intermittent because it would reset every hour or less.  I purchased another one this time on Amazon.  We will see how this one works out.<br />UPDATE  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS WATCH.  I had a Timex that lasted for 10 years, the TWO Casio's did not last.  The first reset to the default time after 9 months, the second had the same problem after 17 months.  I changed my review from two stars to ONE star., I purchased this for my six year old who loves trains. It is a functional watch and has a very nice look to it. The cover is easy to open. My son adores it and loves to use it when he is pretending to be a train conductor., Gave the watch as a gift to my husband. He loves watches and this one was different from anything he has. He really liked it and thought it was very good quality., Excellent, Decent watch for the money., Poor packaging and no product info. Disappointing ., This watch is very elegant , the trouble is that I get to my country with depleted batteries, Disappointed. Good looking face but the band was super thin a felt very cheap. Returned, This time piece is perfect. The 48mm size is a nice over sized look with out being too extreme. The weight of the watch is surprisingly on the lighter side, matched with the leather band makes a nice fit on the wrist. This is my third Stuhrling and really happy with the quality of the brand. Get compliments all the time when wearing a Stuhrling watch., got this as a surprise out of the blue from wife and daughter. hansom field watch. green face and automatic winding makes this perfect for on the trail or on the town., I just got this watch and it is absolutely worth the price. It's perfect for either casual wear or it's a perfect watch to wear to the office., plastic strap is crap but very durable watch for work, Band broke within 2 days of wearing it, do not recommend buying it., It was false advertisement, doesn't even work., Love it!<br />Wears it all the time - but I need to have make it smaller because I have really small wrists., This watch is not working,aparently The battery is not working, I love watched so I was happy when I was able to buy this one at a great price.  It is so pretty and will go with any outfit I wear.  If you know watches you know that Geneva is a great brand and will last a very long time.  When I received my watch it was set and ready to go.  I even bought 3 extra so that I can use them as gifts.  What I liked about this watch is that is a silicone band and it did not make my wrist sweet at all.  I did receved this nice watch at a discount price for my honest review., As one reviewer wrote already, the removable &#34;pillow&#34; doesn't fit snug enough into the winder to securely hold a heavier watch like the larger metal Rolexes. You will need to stuff cotton balls Or some wadding into the sides or rig up some rubber bands--unacceptable. Poor design. The construction is cheap. It is cheap plastic and looks like Chinese junk like most things from China. The winder last a few years with very limited use. Do not buy this. You will be disappointed., This is brilliant!, Kinda exactly what you would expect from an $89 automatic watch.  If it was truly waterproof, like wear in the shower, would be 3 stars., I wasn't expecting much.  Basically wanted a watch that didn't have the fake leather strap that disintegrates is a few months.<br />the problem with this watch is the strap.  It is ultra-thin and flimsy.  This makes it difficult to put on.  I had to develop a whole new level of dexterity to get the thing on.  Each a chore each time., Really good watch.  High quality and great appearance.  The precisionist movement is the best., Absolutely beautiful crafted watch. I've gotten so many compliments when wearing it. :), Its ok. A little big for my kid but its ok, Don't like to type, but I am very pleased with this purchase. Thanks., Order arrived faster than expected, overall highly satisfied with product., Awesome watch, that's all I can say. Durable, efficient self-winding, get's lots of admiring looks :)<br />I've had it a long while now and I still love wearing it., I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift. (2014)<br />Looks decent, he loved it. He has worn this watch selectively. Unfortunately it stopped working after 6 months.<br />I have owned and worn other Swiss watches in my collection, this one looks expensive and decent, but feels cheaply made.<br />It is all show, and no craftsmanship at all. Swiss watches will last for years if not generations. It is not even worth the price I paid, it is not even worth $20. Warranty is just a joke; prepaid return shipping is $20, plus the cost of mailing it to them; all this for a watch that is not even worth $20.<br />This is the second watch we own in the family from the same brand and company. Mine failed within 3 months of scant usage.<br />Buyers beware! don't be fleeced. Spend your money wisely., Excellent quality, I didnt have very high expectations for this watch, i bought it because it looked cool and was only $69. As advertised, it does look nice and it actually keeps time surprisingly well., I was happy with this watch until today. Out of blue it has generated some moisture inside. Seller recommended that I should contact manufacturer i.e. Casio., It looks really nice, was a good weight feeling. The bracelet is too long for women's wrists, but I just had some pieces removed and now fits perfect., What u see is what u get, Not bad for its price. I thought the elephant would be pearlized but it's not., It's better than what I wish.My friend like it very much., It's nicest more than what I got, This is a cute, nicely functioning watch that our school-teacher daughter grabbed up and claimed as her own. She needed a newer, nicer watch to wear to the classroom, and this watch fit her needs perfectly.<br /><br />This battery-powered watch keeps good time, is lightweight and is comfortable to wear. The strap adjusts easily to wrist size, and the underside of the watch is nicely curved to fit well against the shape of the wrist.<br /><br />The Amazon listing notes that a 2 year warranty is available through the Amazon Asurion program, so if an issue occurs before that period expires I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.<br /><br />If you are looking for fun, cute battery operated watch of this size and style, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this watch a try based on her experience with it (she kept it and took it home with her).<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience., Excellent, I like it.  It is the right size, somewhat larger than a typical watch but not huge like some of the dive watches.  Nice style, comfortable, easy to read, keeps exact time.  It worked great for kayaking today in rough weather, and I am looking forward to my diving trip., The watch has a beautiful design and understated looks. Each Item of the watch face has a purpose. The numbers are situated where the time is really easy to read.  Please note that the watch band in 20mm and is not 18mm.  I thought the watch band was cheap and I quickly replace it. Even though I use it as my main dress watch, it seems at times the watch can look a little too playful for a dress watch., I use this watch when I have to time something in the shop like all seikos this is a good watch and never disappoints., This watch died within three months. Very disappointing., I liked the design. Setting the temperature was a pain. The biggest problem I had was how uncomfortable the band was. I set everything first and then when I went to put the watch on, I realized that the band was too hard and inflexible to be comfortable., Very large display and easy to read. One star deducted as the face scratches easily. Another deducted as the velcro band wears pretty quickly., Cute watch, inexpensive, really adds bling., Need to returned because has a scratch on the surface, Took this to the jewelry shop to get the band adjusted. Jeweler commented on nice quality of the watch., If using with a moto 360 you have to cut the guide tabs off of your watch for it to fit. I had to damage my watch before i figured this out., Excellent product.really stands for is self, Definitely satisfied with my purchase!, The watch was already broken when I received it in the mail. Pool quality watch., It does not work!, I'm dissappointes with this product. The gold color is gone at the first time of use., This added just the right length to my watch., I like everything about this watch except for the fact that it was dead on arrival.  The watch would not wind manually, nor would it hold a kinetic wind.  I'm either returning it to buy another brand or giving Invicta another (slim) chance.  It's a shame because this one looks the best out of all the Submariner homages., Pros:<br />- Very easy to read watch face.  Numbers are clear.  Date is easy to read.<br />- Very quite.  You cannot hear any ticking.<br />- Light weight on my arm.<br />- Attractive look for a lower priced watch.  The watch head itself does not look cheap.<br />- Water resistant.<br />- Numbers glow in the dark!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- As others have said before me, the band is cheap.  You will want another band.  Band feels like cheap &#34;leather&#34; and does not bend well.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I for one think this is an impressive watch for a lower price.  While the band can be replaced (and mine will), the watch itself is nice.  I appreciate not having to squint my eyes to look at the face.  The fact that it is water resistant is excellent., I would love it if it would have come with a working battery. I had to pay 9.97 to replace the used battery. Also had to take it to a battery shop to open it and check it because the tab had already been pulled, which tells me it must have been a used watch., First off the items I ordered came pretty quick which was cool.  The watch is actually pretty dope, I had to take out two links for it to fit more firm on my wrist which is why I'm so happy I ordered the HTS 1940HO 16piece watch repair kit, the box of the repair kit tells you what each piece is used for but there are no instructions telling you how to use them but I kinda figured a few out so far.  The watch is really impressive, I'm still trying to figure out some features.  I think I'm ready to shop for some other styles from this brand but it is definitely a man's -man watch, This is a great looking watch. I get compliments everywhere i go. Its not very durable though. The glass scratches easily but my main gripe with this watch is that its not waterproof despite the fact that it clearly states 99 feet water resistant. I took a shower with this watch and water started to enter the mechanical parts. I returned this watch 3 times with the same results. I also took it to a watch repair shop to see if they can do anything about it but they told me that they would be afraid to mess with it cause it looks to intricate to mess around with and parts are scarce. I finally just gave up and kept the watch but will not trust it to get wet. Such a shame cause its really a hot looking watch but i shouldn't have to worry about taking it out and ruining it due to rain., I only have one thing to warn about this watch. While it is beautiful and stylish. If you think it's black and gold it is not. Only the face is black. The rest of the links are actually a gray with gold. Not black. it may say that in the description and perhaps I should have read closer. But fair warning the picture could be more accurate of the color in the links, Awesome all the way around. Would purchase again but it is a Timex and they last forever., Stopped keeping time after 4 months, I picked this Yellow Hammerhead @ West Marine for 50% off retail online ($62.50) No tax in New Hampshire. When it came in a week later, I was so surprised @ how small it is. No way it's 42mm. The dial/faceplate is more like 40mm (if that) It wears small. I was a skinny wrist so I decided to keep it. The strap is 22mm but it tapers down & it helps with it's small appearance.<br /><br />Pros: Price. Lifetime warranty. Nice aesthetics (@ least for me) Light weight. To my surprise the second hand is dead on with the dial face marks. Very good time keeper overall. So far solid with snorkeling for hours on end. The strap has a really nice feel to it. The lumination feature is worthy & comes in handy. I like the crown, it feels solid.<br /><br />Cons: Date window. Too damn small (why even bother) Setting the date can be a tad tricky sometimes. No manual came with watch. No biggie as I downloaded it from Freestyle's website.<br /><br />I've owned this for about 6 months now. So far so good. I use it as my boat beater watch in the summer in New England. I wouldn't recommend the Hammerhead with a guy with large wrists, it's simply too small. Would I pay retail for this watch? Not in a million years. There are so many other options that blows this timepiece away for $125.00-$150.00 Granted, all of us didn't pay retail price. If this watch was 2mm-3mm larger it would make a big difference. I would categorize this watch as average @ the price I paid. If you can find it cheap, then it might work for some people.<br /><br />Cons:, This is a very nice watch for the price. I'm thinking about buying more in different colors., Sturdy and a good value.  I find that the blade can get loose from the handle, since they are replaceable blades.  You can fix it easily with a tiny dab of rubber cement., Heavy duty and simple. Just what I wanted., I really liked the watch and the way it looks and then the battery died after 5 weeks. I have four others and the batteries are all working,  so I don't know what's up with it. I know that I don't want to try and change it., Product description is quite clear that model 4JF is being offered, which is a japan domestic market watch. What you will receive is a model 4DR, which looks the same but is the export model made in Thailand.  Some may argue these are essentially the same watch, but the difference is important to those ordering based on the model number.  Deceptive., I understand that the termin &#34;wet&#34; application scares a lot of people off, but it's really &#34;damp&#34; application, and it's the best way to get a good application.<br />The solution you use is a couple drops of dish soap (not with any lotions or stuff...just regular &#34;lemon-fresh Joy&#34; will do the trick) in a cup of water. This is mostly to get the grease and sweat and everything off your fingers, but there's another purpose as well. You dip your fingers in the solution, then dip the protector in the solution...and shake off as much of the solution as you can. Really, it's not supposed to be dripping wet when you put it on your electronic device. There should *just barely* be enough of the soap-and-water solution to form a thin layer between the screen and the protector so you can move it around to just the perfect position on the screen. Now push the excess water out with the squeegee and VOILA! you've got a perfectly-positioned screen protector.<br /><br />Also, I know the manufacturer says to give it a couple days for all the bubbles to disappear and become fully clear...mine took about half an hour. Honestly, half an hour later it was so clear I thought it might have fallen off! I had to use a magnifying glass and look very closely to make sure I could see the edge of the protector.<br /><br />This protector covers the WHOLE screen of the Galaxy Gear Live (unlike another brand I tried first that left at least 1/8&#34; all the way around that wasn't covered, and would get caught on things and peeled up...so I used all three in the pack I got from them in less than two months).<br /><br />There is one drawback, but it is not specific to this product. Clear screen protectors get fingerprint smudges every time you touch them. It's just the nature of the beast.<br /><br />I've had this on my Gear Live for a couple weeks now, and I've not had a single problem with it. No edges catching, no peeling, no discoloration. If anything changes, I'll update the review, but for now, I recommend this screen protector without any reservations.he review, but for now, I recommend this screen protector without any reservations., I shopped many watches before I decided on this Timex model.  I've been wearing Timex watches for the last several years and have found them to be reliable and reasonably priced, so I was pretty much set on buying a Timex.  I have one of their Weekender models with a couple of different straps, which I alternate depending on what I'm wearing, and I really like it.  I also had a dressy model with the same easy-to-read dial that had an expansion band, and it died on me after several years, so I bought this watch as a replacement.  The watch works fine, and I like the easy-to-read dial and also the fact that it has the Indiglo light.  Plus, the watch is attractive.  I was disappointed, however, in the band.  The expansion band on my old watch fit perfectly, and the edges of the band were nicely rounded and smooth so that it was very easy and comfortable to put on and take off.  However, the band on this new watch seems a little bit smaller, so it tends to pinch a bit.  Also, the edges are sharper, which makes the watch rather uncomfortable to put on and remove.  This was a let down.  I don't know if these differences are due to a decline in quality control, an effort to reduce costs, or what.  I considered returning the watch and buying a different model, but since there wasn't actually anything wrong with the watch, I knew I'd have to pay return shipping, and I didn't want to invest that extra money.  So I kept the watch.  But I'm not entirely happy with it, solely because of the band.  Of course, that's the problem with shopping online--you can't try it on before you buy.  If you have a thin wrist, this band may be fine for you, but if you have an average or larger wrist, you may likewise be dissatisfied., I love the look of this watch - a big chunky silver face and band. Really cool. My issue is that the second hand keeps stopping so the watch doesn't keep accurate time. I have to re-set it each day. If it worked correctly this would be a five-star watch!, Face color a bit brassy for my taste., Doing the job so far.  I bought it for my 13 y.o. who runs XC and track.  It's a little big for him but the functionality is great., Iwas a BIG hit with my Grand daughter!! Thank you. Lois, Exactly what i wanted! Sparkly and cute!, Just received both of these , can't decide which to keep. Left side G700-1 watch is very easy to see. Right side GD350-1B is a bit on the dark side. Love em both though., The watch band showed up exactly as described. It looks great. My only critique is that the strap is a little long. I folded it over the same as I used to do for a synthetic watch band I used before and you can see the lighter underside of the part I folded over., This watch fit my wrist perfectly. I have had it for a few months now and I have had zero issues. Would buy it again or recommend to a friend., So far .. so good.  (Yes, I read all the negative reviews on the web about Invicta watches and the Invicta company in general, which, if you believe the reviews, it sounds like the IRS has better customer service skills).<br />I liked the look of this watch and expect to use it as a 'heavy duty' time piece to spare my various Rolex's the wear & tear of everyday use.  A couple of immediate observations  ... (i) the manual pretty much sucks, you would do better to check the video's on YouTube for setting and calibrating the Pro-Diver Chronographs, and (ii) as an experienced SCUBA Instructor, I would be leery using this watch in anything deeper than a bucket of water, let alone 300 feet. The model I purchased does not have a 'screw-down' crown - although some other models in the 'Pro Diver Collection do - so I have a hard time believing this is water resistant at any depth.<br /><br />I'll update later if anything fails or fall-off., day 2 at the bar of owning the watch. strap broke as shown in the picture -- really put a damper on my night.. head of watch still holding up and is stellar. strap is a joke so will be contacting vendor in future to look into buying replacement straps/getting this one replaced. The strap aesthetically is unique and was my favorite part originally, but clearly quality was lost. Love the face of this watch tho. Price/Compliment ratio well worth the investment., ENORMOUS watch.  I have big hands and arms but this is HUGE.  I is a nice looking watch, very solid and comfortable to wear but its not a daily watch unless you take it off every night.  The band is solid, the bezel and case are sharp and well made., It feels really cheap, i have three invictas and for the prize i'll go next time with invicta. Very small for me, This is a beautiful watch, Love this watch! I can tell it's well made just from the feel. I'm getting a lot of compliments on  it as I wear it around., BUREI is offering a surprisingly good looking, high quality watch, at a price that seems too low. I can say this because I've purchased a dozen watches in the past few years and, I believe that only one was under $200.<br /><br />I'm showing you my pictures just so that you know that this isn't any bait and switch, the rose gold accents on the dial and around it, look like rose gold and the calfskin band looks good also.<br /><br />You'll also notice that the size is on the large side of  average for today's dress watches. I mainly wear dress watches every day, like the Citizen Eco-Drive that you see, and switch to flashier dress watches at times. This Burei watch fits right in with my others that were more than twice the price and you'll also see that it comes ready to be a gift.<br /><br />The stem has the two stop pull for setting the date and then the time. The band is really pretty nice and seems to be the normal 8.5 inch length, that will fit an 8 inch wrist and still allow you to tuck the end of the band in. This says that it's using a sapphire crystal, and that means better scratch resistance and it somewhat reduces reflection also, making this watch easy to read.<br /><br />The case is on the thinner side of average and I really look for this in my watches. I'm not the type who wears a giant sized, flopping, loose watch and this is not that style. It's sleeker and less trouble when wearing long sleeves, and I don't bang it against doorjambs when walking through a doorway either.<br /><br />It's plenty water resistant, and of course you'll want to protect the band more than the watch, I shower with my metal banded watches rated like this one is all the time.<br /><br />Now I've only been wearing this watch about a week, but today I can not only recommend it, but if this is what you were looking for, I could dare you to try and find a better deal. This is flat out a nice watch.<br /><br />It's 8/23/15, and if I forget to update, leave me a comment, and I'll tell you how it's doing in 6 months or a year. I'm talking about wear, because I'll surely be back if it quits working.<br /><br />Product sent to me for testing and evaluation.ell you how it's doing in 6 months or a year. I'm talking about wear, because I'll surely be back if it quits working.<br /><br />Product sent to me for testing and evaluation., Very light, nice colors, the package came as it  had been manipulated.  Fits my wrist just fine, looks beautiful too., Small enough to not overwhelm my tiny wrists, but not so small that it begins to look comical. The strap is a substantial material and it loops through the watch, so I think these can be interchangeable. The colors are exactly as shown in the picture and the face even lights up. I think it's a great purchase for the price and people compliment it every time I wear it. Will be buying more of these., Watch looks good, seems to keep accurate time so far, and was reasonably priced.  My husband is happy for the most part with this replacement for his old Timex that died, but wished that he had had a choice of color on the band as he prefers black., I bought two bangle bracelet wrist watches for my 101 year old mother to have in  the nursing home. She loves them and thinks they are really<br />beautiful. Best part is she does not have to wind them or worry about buckles or clips to put them on., My husband bought this watch as a gift to himself.  He's been wearing it for several months now.  Looks great on him; nice large size; holding up well., Watch came in MK original box w/ the booklet and everything. Watch looks good! Very authentic. Small wrist, so I'll have to get sized., Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, one of the three I ordered appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.<br /><br />First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the &#34;full&#34; price, and even the &#34;sale&#34; prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that it was an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought a total of three watches from Heritor, paying in the $120-$170 range (marked, allegedly, &#34;80-90% off&#34; their respective fake prices), and while one arrived broken, the other two, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.<br /><br />The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate. Heritor's website provides more specific mechanical details of each model, but you really can't trace the movement to any particular make of any particular notoriety. The Day of Week and Day of Month complications (in the watches that have them) appear to legitimately function, although the Month indicator is manually advanced at best. The Automatic winding wheel works as advertised as well. The watch face does have a quality look to it, although some of Heritor's designs and colorations can be gaudy or difficult to read. The leather watch bands they come with are garbage, but replaceable--while they do appear to use genuine leather on the outside, the layer is thin, and thickness is given by a middle layer of foam. This makes it brittle enough to not withstand years or even months of buckling and unbuckling. If you like the band, wear it until it breaks, then replace it, otherwise just replace it right away with a metal band. I would not expect this watch to be durable. Don't wear it in the shower, or drop it, or wear it while working on things where you might be banging it up against things. If you think you can take good care of it though, and you enjoy wearing and looking at a mechanical skeleton watch, you may get your money's worth at least... but seeing as how you can't afford a Rolex now, I wouldn't expect you'll be able to afford one when this wears out or breaks, either.<br /><br />Personally of the three I bought, I like the aesthetic of the Lennon the most. It's rather thick and bulky, but classy looking and easy to read.vertised as well.

It's rather thick and bulky, but classy looking and easy to read., Very classy look and beautiful watch. A little bit heavy. But i don't mind. The price is very reasonable, compared to walk in retails stores and other website. i saved about $150.00 plus buy it on Amazon.com. Loved it...!, Gorgeous watch. Jus not sure how to adjust the wrist strap., Very classy watch!!!, It was already running when I received it.  How long will it Last?  It was inexpensive though., Very pleased with this watch.  Keeps great time and gets lots of compliments!  One note though; when I purchased mine, the description said it was an automatic...but it's not.  No big deal to me, but if you are set on an automatic this is not the watch for you., Great product, very easy to use. Opened many of my watches, with the exception of Fossil, quite easily. The Fossil watches require a different tool., fits and looks almost childlike, I'm so happy with this watch! My husband got this for me for my birthday and it came so fast! It is beautiful and it is an original for sure as it comes in the original MK packaging and has the true MK labels on the watch. It's so elegant and gorgous and I couldn't be happier!, Cheap no star, It's okay you get what you pay for, Cheap foam, I really like the look of the watch, but the clasp broke in 6 months of normal usage.  Disappointed in the poor design- a thin strip of metal for the clasp hinge just doesn't hold up., I've been using puma unisex sport watches for a few years now, and every time I loose one (one in a lake, one in a foam pit, and one in the shuffle of moving to a new home) I get another. They're sturdy, colorful, easy to use, and they manage to be on the larger side without making me look goofy (I'm a pretty slim girl with small wrists) which i like. I'm a gymnastics coach and I use the stopwatch all of the time at work and I love how big the numbers are. It stands up to the chalk dust and abuse it gets while I set up equipment (I've given them a few good smacks against metal and there have been definite screen scratches but nothing to damage the functionality of the watch.) I use and abuse my sport watches and these stand up well. To the people with smaller wrists, I use the second to last hole on the strap because my wrists are tiny but it looks fine and the strap doesn't stick up like some tend to do. Two thumbs up, Beautiful watch. 48mm is pretty big but it doesn't feel too big. I've got a different 50mm but it seems too big because it's so much thicker than this watch.<br /><br />Band is nice and flexible, not stiff. And, why did no one ever think of their little trick to keep the loop that holds the excess band in place before? What a great idea: Put a tab on the end of the band and a notch in the loop and they stay together. Brilliant!<br /><br />Chrono seems good although I haven't found out if there is a lap timer function. Not a big deal for me because I like chronos simply because they LOOK better. I rarely use the function.<br /><br />Totally preference but I like the white numbers in this model over the darker numbers models. I showed this to a buddy and he showed me his identical version but with the dark numbers. Mine's definitely easier to see., Clock would not work … don't believe any clock works were IN the clock frame. Batteries made the pendulum work - nothing else.<br /><br />I returned the clock. Amazon refunded all monies., This really does a nice job on acrylic crystals.  A little goes a long way.  I used this on several older watches and they cleaned up nicely.  Won't remove deep scratches but makes them less noticeable.  If I ever manage to use up this tube I'd buy it again., It runs and is pretty - but the clasp easily unhooks and the watch constantly is falling off my wrist.  I gave it three stars for its look and price., Very pretty watch but was broken when I received it so I had to send it back., It's beautiful. I'm infatuated., I needed a large-faced watch that was sturdy and could easily be read at night. This watch fulfills those requirements. However, I wasn't expecting a watch this heavy and wide. I have to either wear the strap tightly or loosely. Worn tightly, my tiny wrist is uncomfortable. Worn loosely, the watch face  slips away from my line of sight. Another good feature is the military or Continental time numbers around it. The price was right also., Cheap. Pin pops out constantly and falls off my wrist., Looks good looks a little cheap but is a 20 bucks whatch, returned too big, A smart watch with nice features but also some design flaws.  E.g.  flat tire display, dated CPU, dismal battery, and cracking of plastic back.  Hopefully motorola can correct these flaws in the next version<br /> I would not have gotten this watch at the original price.  But it can be a 1st android wear watch at current $150 or less price point., When you travel this is the perfect watch.  Just press the stem and the face light up and no matter if day or night you can see what time it is.  It has a large face, so it is very readable, and it has the fabric band so you never feel uncomfortable with the heat or cold because it backs the watch.  I really enjoy it!, I've had this watch for just a week but it's keep time well. I also like the black and steal loom of the dial.I have a collection of watches ranging from cheap $40 use and toss, through battery operated mechanisms, to expensive $3000+ watches. Mechanical = automatic or hand-winding watches are definitely the best way to go. If you have several automatics, buy a cheap watch-winder on Amazon, or wherever. Just make sure the small motor that rotates your watches is quiet! I got a brilliant 8 watch winder with storage for 8 more for $240. Great convenience, as well as good display. I also prefer leather bands and deployment clasps, which this model has. They can be expanded or tightened easily, according to the weather and ones usage, and they don't scratch as link bracelets do. They are also readily replaced when worn out, or when you just want a change. I have one question about this watch though; The sub-dial for the seconds can't be stopped when setting the watch time, hence even if your hours/minutes are accurate, the seconds are out, albeit slightly. usually pulling out the crown stops the seconds too. Unless I've missed something, or mine has a fault, you can't do this on this watch,as they keep right on ticking away. A small but noticeable design/movement fault I think., Love this watch, already have one in black, no problems., First thing is I'm not just pleased with this watch but overjoyed. I ordered it to replace a Luminox Trascer watch, which had been stolen, as I have a requirement to clearly see the time during the hours of darkness. I was astounded on the first night of wearing it just how bright and clear it was. A very good feature is that the twelve position is red and very clearly so. Consequently there is no chance of ambiguity in reading the hour. I set the time to the IPad clock when I got delivery and in three weeks it has lost one second, if that. I've been owner of several watches as I like to vary it in the way women vary jewellery. This watch has not left my wrist since purchase nor will it. Shower, swim, dive, whatever. I don't think I'll go down to 200 metres, but I could. Recommendation? Most definitely. I'm thrilled with it., perfect fit., Excellent, Topwell has done it again with another fashionable watch. This watch has so much detail in it and I love the different colors of wood. We have a t-shirt company and I love mixing streetwear with these wooden watches. It is just the right amount of pop and the perfect addition to our line. Nevertheless, that is not to say that this would not look amazing with a suit and tie either. This is an accessory that goes above and beyond. The thought that went into this piece is undeniable. I received this watch at a discount in exchange for my honest review., Great summer watch, my leather bands were starting to stink and I've worn this every day since I bought it with no wrist stink happening. The brown leather bands that hold the end of the wristband have worn a bit from wear, but they're are on the bottom so it doesn't show. I personally like the Danish style minimal design and I still get complimented on it from people for the chambray. The face is a bit thicker than the Skagen watches I usually wear, so I sometimes catch it on doorways being careless in my small apt, but the glass and metal frame have held up well despite my efforts. I hope it lasts me another few years because it's comfortable and matches most of what I wear in the summer., Excellent service and superb follow-up. A top notch operation., Watch worked fine, didn't find the rubber band to be comfortable., Awesome watch, looks super nice although it is a little heavy., Poor quality doesnt tell correct time runs fast, looks nice but not a premium feel. When you can actually notice the seconds hand of the watch is going too fast theres something wrong. I was hoping to get a nice watch for a cheap price but you gotta spend a little more for better quality. The the minute hand doesnt line up correctly with seconds hand either. Theres no point to have 2 extra buttons for show on the side either. Very nice looking but a subpar knockoff watch., Good looking watch, keeps time excellent, I love that I never have to take it off when I shower, like to see what the date is, and this watch is very comfortable. so light weight,don't even realize that i have it on. And that's the way I like it., It looks great. Not sure why they call it a casual watch. It looks like a dress watch.<br /><br />My only major complaint is that the metal clasp sticks into the skin quite a bit. After wearing it for a while, it would hurt and it left a deep impression in my arm.<br /><br />The background texture is dramatic in the product photo but typically invisible in normal lighting.<br /><br />The date window is small but no smaller than my other watch.<br /><br />Only the hands glow in the dark, and even then, they are barely visible in pitch black. Don't buy this if you need to see it in the dark.<br /><br />Does NOT make any kind of ticking noise. Completely silent.<br /><br />The band smells like leather and is stamped with &#34;genuine leather&#34;.<br /><br />The glass is called &#34;sapphire&#34; glass, which I guess is scratch resistant. I've only had this for a week but no scratches so far. My Casio with &#34;mineral crystal&#34; has some deep visible scratches. I'm not sure if mineral crystal is the same as sapphire glass., my daughter wears this all the time, It is classic design, that's fit my everyday outfits., doesnt keep the best time...second hand and digital seconds off..had it 3 weeks now and it doesnt keep time well.....other than that,its not a bad watch., First and foremost this master piece is more stunning in person then I could imagine. What are you waiting for? Quit wondering and get this damn watch on your wrist! You will not be let down on how much detail they put into this watch., Pretty bummed the gold cooling wears off a $250 purchase so damn fast. Just sitting at my desk typing caused this in just a few weeks..., Luv it Ty gift for my grandson, My Husband's favorite g-shock needed the strap loop. After reading a series of reviews we measured the band width and it was 20mm. So the best choice would be to get the 22mm strap we thought. But turns out loop was a little bigger for the watch but hey! It still does the job of keeping the strap in place..no issues. The seller was gracious enough to send us a pair for $4.80., Love the way the watch looks. Excellent quality watch arrived before time from Discount Watch Store., What can i say i have over 30 invicta watches and they keep impressing me, wore this watch and everybody was asking about it looks really good on the wrist and very comfortable. and amazon prices cannot be beat, I really wanted a watch with an hourly chime (to remind me to stand up and stretch at least every hour!), and tried this one even though the description does not state that it has this function. In fact, this watch actually DOES have an hourly chime (that you can turn on and off), even though it's not stated as such. Here are directions in case it's useful to someone else:<br />  -Press & hold the &#34;set/recall&#34; button when you're in time mode.<br />  -Press &#34;mode&#34; button repeatedly until you get to the &#34;chime on/off&#34; screen.<br />  -Press &#34;start/split&#34; or &#34;stop/reset&#34; button to toggle between on/off.<br />  -Press &#34;set/recall&#34; (done) to exit.<br /><br />I love everything about this watch, particularly the slim watchband, and the clever way the strap loop grabs the band and prevents sliding. Would absolutely buy again!, Great-looking watch. Nice quality. Love the eco drive because I hate changing watch batteries. My main pet peeve is that the luminescence is lacking. Very hard to see the dial or the numbers when I wake up in the middle of the night compared to my two other eco drives. They really should fix that issue because it does detract from the quality of the watch. If not for that issue, I would have given five stars., Japanese built Seikos are always good value for the money and generally keep better time than their Swiss counterparts. I have a 15 year old 7S26 which is still ticking and keeping reasonable time A  8 year old Seiko 23 jewel Superior not built in Japan not good quality. A 12 year old Vostok 2416B which keeps better time than my Rolex.The true test is that of time., My wife loves it.  A few years ago, as a gift, I gave her a Seiko solar watch.  It died.  It was very tiny, and had few features.  It was very fussy. I bought this Casio as a replacement.  It is a real, tough watch, but it is also extremely elegant.  A great watch that is styled for a woman.  However, it is still very high tech, not just a piece of &#34;glam.&#34;  It is a &#34;set it, and forget it&#34; watch:  Solar charging, automatic, satellite atomic clock.  A lot of stuff is packed into this little watch.  I've had a men's Casio solar/satellite watch for over five years.  I have never re-set it.  Both watches reset at midnight, automatically, to the exact second.  Casio should sell this watch in the US!<br />A great woman's watch and it is totally maintenance free., This is an absolutely gorgeous watch! I was worried that the face/case would be too big for my skinny little wrist, but it looks great! The watch arrived brand new in the box, with all the tags and plastic face protector attached. No complaints whatsoever! I've received many compliments. I love this watch!!, Can't beat a swatch for accuracy, durability, and price., Brings out the animal in her., Amazing and elegant, As I have complained before, this watch does not light and did not come with any instruction manual. Item earmarked for return as soon as I find time to do so.., This is fine automatic watch in the mid-range price bracket circa $2,500. It's lovely to look at and easy to read. It won't suit everyone as the Pink or Rose Gold toned case is really more 'orange' to my eye, but the gold is plated, not sprayed on!. The calibre that drives the watch is a 'manufactured' or in-house calibre. Only 1888 of them were made. FC watches are underrated by aficionados, but they offer something unique, and with quality to those who buy them. I think, over the years, they'll hold their value, or at least not depreciate as munch as some other more expensive brands.The roman numerals are printed as far as I can tell, not applied by hand, which is a small shame. The date dial is easy to read, and the dial face has some interesting patterned work which makes it interesting. Needless to say, the crystal, front and back, is sapphire, man-made of course, like all the other brands and like the Jewels in modern watches, unless you're super rich and can afford real jewels of course!. A good quality watch with its own FC calibre., I first noticed the Ice-Watch as it was worn by an  French Olympic women's saber fencer, and I thought it was cool. When we were in France for vacation in July, 2015, I noticed the Ice Watches in the jewelry stores.  Upon returning to Pennsylvania, I noted that my local stores did not sell this brand of watch.  I was pleased to be able to find one at a reasonable price.  I now have a good, stylish watch.  It is good to have a young style rather than always wearing a stodgy watch., Outstanding, So far, the best watch I have owned., It is o.k., The watch is attractive and I liked it, however after 3 days the battery was dead. I sent a message to the seller and within 3 days the seller sent me 2 new batteries. Very prompt, quick service.  The watch is a good price for a Timex., Small in size, but perfect that it can still be seen on my bracelet., THIS IS THE 5TH INVICTA WATCH I BOUGHT AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL, LARGE AND MAKES A STATEMENT. IT TELLS THE TIME, THE DATE, HAS A STOPWATCH TO THE TENTH OF A SECOND.  THE COLOR OF ROSE  GOLD AND STAINLESS STEEL MAKE THE WATCH OUTSTANDING.  THE WATCH IS SO WELL HANDCRAFTED IN EVERY DETAIL.  STAINLESS STEEL SCREWS ARE SET IN SOME OF THE LINKS.  SIZING THE BEAUTIFUL 2 COLOR BAND IS A BREEZE WITH THE TOOLS I PURCHASED ON AMAZON. THE PRICE ON AMAZON WAS OUTSTANDING. DELIVERY WAS FAST AND THE INVICTA WATCH CAME COMPLETELY COVERED IN PLASTIC, IN A BEAUTIFUL WATCH.<br /> I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO INCREASING MY COLLECTION OF THESE BEAUTIFUL INVICTA WATCHES., It is certainly a watch for outdoor activity enthusiasts especially if you are into diving and water sports. I am sure it is well built with the usual Seiko fastidiousness to quality. The dial diameter is not too big, but I found it a bit daunting because of its thickness. I would find it difficult to wear it comfortably to the office or a party with a long sleeved shirt buttoned down. Since I was looking for a more dual purpose watch,  I returned it., Pretty watch, but changing bands isn't as easy as they want you to think., Looks better in person, worth the money., I have purchased four Geneva watches in the last year plus. I had issues with three in total. Three of the three issues were addressed. I received a replacement watch for a faulty band on one. I received credit for one that wouldn't function after two months. The final defective one, I never heard back the seller. The fourth one is still functioning, but I am skeptical as to how long it will last given the makes track record with my experience. All I wished for was to add a few inexpensive watches to my wardrobe for tasks that I didn't want to wear my higher end watches for.<br />Bottom line, you get what you pay for. For any future buyer, you will have an issue at some point, believe me., beautiful watch, i like how they are built, Perfect fit, returned., I am very happy with this product., Well worth the money. I swim with this watch everyday., Outstanding watch . I can't believe the quality of this watch and how well it keeps time., The watch is of decent quality. I didn't even bother with the instructions, I just followed the instructions given by other reviewers and it wasn't a problem to figure it out. I had the time and date set within 5 minutes...it was a bit tricky with the &#34;hold for two seconds then release and hold another second&#34;. I would give it 4 or 5 stars if I had been sent the right color, though!! That was was a huge disappointment, it said pink in the description and showed a pink watch but they sent me the blue version. It arrived the day of my daughter's birthday and I didn't want her to not have a gift to open, so I wrapped it and told her after that I could send it back and get the pink (she specifically asked for a pink watch) but she was was so eager to have a watch and wear it that she kept the blue. I know the day will come, though, that she'll start talking about how she actually wanted a pink one., The slots are too small for my invicta watch collection., Band broke after two days of wearing it, looking to buy a leather band replacement for it, do not recommend, Product arrived timely and as described., The quality of this band is good for what you pay for. If you're like me, you probably find more comfort in a metal band like this instead of the leather band that the watch comes with. I was not good at installing the band, so I took it to a jewelry shop at my local mall and they said they would install it for free... I just had to give my attention to the sales person showing me stuff while the other guy installed my band.<br /><br />Bottom line. This band looks better than the standard leather and feels better., This watch later nice--was exactly what my daughter was looking for...but the rhinestones inside watch face became loose and float around, banging in the watch's hands., It IS in the description, however didn't realize how large this watch face is! It will be a gift for my husband 9/11, I will update when he opens it!, Awesome, Esta chingon, The SKX007 supposed to be my watch breater, as soon as I put it on the strapcode super oyester I feel in love with it and treat it like a baby. The watch is perfect in about every way, especially considering the price and of course you have to get the JDM model so you can be reminded of the 21 jewels ;), I love Watches I use this everyday, its fun once you get it, the only thing is that its hard to keep it on time!, Excellent product, beautiful design, it's perfect, One of the decorative jewels was dangling inside the watch., Looks sharp. Keeps accurate time. Convenient count down timer. As noted by others, it is sometimes difficult to see the screen in bright light., Nice, solidly built watch. Be warned though the face is huge. I understand it is a large faced watch, but the size definitely took me by surprise. I was buying it for my brother who is much smaller than me, so I kept it for myself and bought him another smaller watch., My first review ever. Took this thing surfing all the time broke within 7 months saying ROM FAIL. Do not buy., This is my second 8932. I love the fact that they are comfortable and stylish yet still be an everyday watch., An attractive watch bought as a daily deal, but it loses at least 5 minutes of time each day and is being returned., very poor quality cotton used for stitching, belt loop broke of after second time it was used, Love my Seiko watch. Only reason I bought a new watch is because my previous 25 year old Seiko finally died. So Seiko was the only brand I even considered.<br />This one is lovely with crystals around the bezel & a mother of pearl face.  I have always liked the two tone metal band.<br />Very good value., this is the besr g shock  I have owned, The Best look and the best for the Money!  High Quality!!, The leather is a little thin, but the buckle, and fit and finish are top notch. I gave it 4 stars because I've bought other bands in this price range with much thicker pieces of leather., Very nice product... Worth the money we pay, Leather strap broke within a year., Didn't come with and leaflets or instructions. Shipped fast and although this item is as descirbed, it is a very cheap watch, Beautiful watch.  Keeps good time as of today.  The blue hue that is on the face is beautiful, the black band, I'm afraid, might wear off over time (that is to be expected, right?).  The gold is a right, bright gold and stands out very well against the black metal. I have had many, many people ask me so far where to get this watch from.  It has a nice movement, very easy to adjust the size yourself with tools found at home.  The face is approx 1.75&#34;.  The tachymetre doesn't move on the face of the watch, either.  All-in-all I would buy this again. It has numbers at the outer edge of the watch while towards the middle of the watch it has roman numerals that can be seen through the peekaboo minute and hour hands, a really brilliant idea by them.  On the left there is a minute countdown 5, 10, 15 etc....that doesn't have a hand but looks really cool and doesn't seem like it's out of place.  the gold against the black is really very stunning., Love this watch, and I get tons of compliments on it. Very stylish and cool., This watch is just BEAUTIFUL! I couldn't be happier! The measurements are listed, but make sure your taste is a large face.  It IS mine, and even with small wrists it fits me perfectly!  I definitely recommend!, This watch was an excellent choice. It fits well and is extremely stylish as well as functional. I am constantly getting compliments on it. You will not be disappointed., My son loves this watch. He wants one in each color. The band fits great and I wide enough that it doesn't dig into his wrist., A bit expensive? Yes. But the leather is solid and the finish is nice and clean. I can confidently say that this strap will last me for years of extended use., This is a beautiful sporty watch came before projected time, In my two pack only one watch worked. The same day that I opened the white watch, the battery stopped working!! Don't Waste your money on these watches., I bought this for my significant other for his birthday, he absolutely freaking adores it! I fell in love with it too. This item is amazing, came in better than I could have expected and looks stunning. I absolutely adore the style of this watch and that something of such a fantastic quality was available for a fandom like One Piece, you don't find a lot of genuinely amazing products like this. We both loved it and would recommend to anyone who's a fan of One Piece with a bit of punkish flare!, Poor quality but that's because it is only $20, Excellent, For 300$ watch this band looks really cheap... But it's really good watch with a lot of features, heavy, big exactly for my wrist., All good- cleans the moisture, etc off watch parts., I bought this watch for myself after trying on my boyfriend's. I wear it at work where I bang it on metal frequently and so far I've avoided scratching the surface. I hate wearing watches but this one's not so bad, I appreciate how clearly I can see each minute marking., The product came in time, all was as advertised.  Love it and so far very quiet!  Thank you!, Arrived from Hong Kong as described. Cool how it displayed the time, Way bigger than expected and cheaply made. Complete waste of money. My daughter was very disappointed., Much smaller then expected, Love the facts that I can adjust the links myself as well as change my own batteries!, poor quality, My son, who is an engineer, had to have this for Christmas! I found it here on Amazon for a good price and bought it!! Whenever I see him, he's wearing it!!, I liked this watch!, Very pretty watch, I suppose this is okay, but it looks very cheaply made and the glow-in-the-dark feature is barely noticeable.  I have not used this at work yet, but I honestly do not have high hopes.  This is mainly a back up watch for when I forget my wrist watch.  I may change this review after use., I was very disappointed with this watch winder. After one day it started to squeak when it was turning loud enough to hear in another room. The watch pillows are too small for mens watches. I returned the unit to Amazon for a refund., Very cheasy watch. Not worth the money. Very hard to figure out, even with directions., I am very pleased with the craftsmanship and quality of the watch. The watch is very classy looking and definitely a conversation starter. To my suprise the band is also made a a very sturdy material as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is interested in quality watches as a reasonable price.<br /><br />On a side note, I have a smaller wrist (6.5in.) and I think the watch looks perfect., Perfect casual watch, can get new bands., I love it!  It's very stylish and comfortable.  It seems to be very well made and I got a great deal on the price.  I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice watch., Cheap!, i like it, The watch is absolutely beautiful. It has a nice weight to it, the color is beautiful, the size is perfect for a female or male wrist, it is easy to set up. Even the box that it came in is a work of art. The winder pull is blue on the end. It has two settings. The first setting allows you to set the date and the second setting allows you to set the  time. The watch's description is unisex however I believe this is more made for a female's wrist. I cannot say enough good things about this watch and I would definitely order it again., I'm So so so so happy with my purchase, To much girth for my 67 speedmaster.  Package said its a replacement for a Rolex.  So be ware., Elegant watch!, doesn't work the watch stops by it self and it is to expensive to get fixed since its a wind ., Bought this watch to keep track off time while paddle boarding. Nice looking watch. Water resistant, had a couple of spills in the water with no issues. Military time to standard time is accomplished by short pressing set button. Wish it was harder to change between the two, because I never want military time displayed. For the price definitely 5 stars. Will wait and see if the water resistance of this watch serves my needs., Well-made watch - have owned similar Seiko diving watches in the past . . . am expecting this one to be just as good, or better., always wanted a venom and got this reserve for a third of the price on other websites. its a big watch so make sure you like big watches. love the distressed look. everybody asks me about my invicta watches when i wear them. they get noticed alot. good quality hand built watch. reserve quality cannot be beat., I have been using this watch for about one year, as a device to keep time it gets the job done, but i am very frustrated with a few aspects. First the watch received is not identical to the one in the picture, as many other said it doesn't contain th Bulova logo in the 12'clock spot, I got this as a present (it was bought on Amazon) but I didn't realize until recently this was the case...if I knew I would have returned it and complained about false advertising. I've always felt that this watch was subpar to others bulova's I own, it is too light, gives the impression that the inside is all plastic...the look and feel is not of a 130 dollar watch, you are much better getting other bulova models, a seiko or a citizen. In all honest though, it is an accurate watch, the strap is real leather, the weekday and date counters work ok, I didn't have any problems with watch itself. I just feel bad that the person that gave me this watch invested this much money on a product that is misleadingly advertised and in a watch that doesnt deliver the look and feel that others in this price range would., The clasp is different from other Anne Klein watches I've had.  It doesn't have the extra link in it, so if your wrists are larger, you may want to try a different Anne Klein design.  My wrists on right on the cusp, so I'll probably just wear it a little tighter than I prefer... not worth the trouble of sending it back.  It's a pretty watch and is as shown.  The little sparkle around the face is subtle and not too much.  Looks like of sporty, but also sophisticated.  Overall, nice watch, good quality., Better quality than I expected. Heavy duty rubber & metal. I expected some plaatic!  I think my son will love it.  The red light is cool. Haven't figured out the setting yet but I only tried for a minute. Lol., The band does not fit the Invicta diver watch, the original has two pins to mount on the watch body which this item lacks. Several attempts were made to get the item to fit , however it resulted in bending the pins., This is a very nice watch. The color combinations really stand out. The price makes this watch more than worth it., The strap looks just like advertised and I had no problems attaching it to my LG G Watch R. However, the band can't be adjusted to be small enough to fit me meaning that I can't use it. The build quality is pretty good but the band is ultimately useless for me since it is way too big even with all of the removable links removed., This is by far my favorite watch...so far! 😀<br />I will say that this is not a small watch, however I'm not a small guy ( 6'5&#34; ).  So it fits me well and looks great on my wrist.  The transaction went smoothly and arrived on time.<br /><br />Note -<br />It seems to me that the manual that arrived with the watch does not cover all the functions. I went to the Invicta web site and the same instructions were online. After poking around for a few minutes I found a different model had better instructions.  Hence four stars instead of five., Why so many product lists mischaracterize the watch window material? The listing below the item says &#34;sapphire coated mineral&#34;. But later on the window material is listed as sapphire.<br /><br />I once made the mistake of buying a sapphire coated watch. It scratched very easily. When it comes to coating the thickness is important. But of course they do not tell you what the thickness is., One of the best watches I own I would recommend to anyone defiantly going to buy one in black also, Watch was fine until stopped working after 30 days. Did not last 2 months. Highly disappointed. To replace the battery i could buy a new watch. Needless to say, my daughter was disappointed., I loved this watch but after my first one broke to pieces on my wrist and the second one became unresponsive I won't buy a third,, ok, Highly satisfied with all features it has to offer, if you're an outdoors type they're definitely handy., The watch seemed decent. I was reaching in a cardboard box and the time adjustment button got ripped off. I put it back on the watch but it fell off later that day. I've never had a watch break this fast, quite disappointing. The ticking is loud but the luminosity was a nice feature. Overall look elsewhere, you can find a better watch at this price., I love my Casio watch! I actually tried to go store-to-store for just a simple white digital water-resistant watch and could not find one anywhere! Everything sold in departments stores or sports retailers are neon colored or black and most variety and styles are for men. I needed to find a watch I could wear with my white scrubs I wear as a uniform and purchase something I wasn't going to be too attached too if I ruined while working. I have super small wrists and was worried that it would be too big, but luckily I was able to wear it on the second to last facet. The watch strap comes with 11 facet holes so it really does fit most people. This watch really offers the style and function I was looking for. I love it!!, A must have. Very stylish. For all occasions., While the end links may not line up absolutely perfectly (which is a common problem with most aftermarket bracelets) the braclet is solid, heavy, and exudes quality. The braclet perfectly mirrors the SKX, a practical buy which will exceed expectations. My SKX007 was meant to be my work beater. After I put this bracelet on I instantly fell in love with the piece and treat like kin. Also it's nice to know a replacement bracelet is less than $70 and a few clicks away., This item was not worth the price, even at the daily value.  The band was thin and when bent, left an indention that wouldn't go away.  I ended up returning this item - not worth the money., Just got this, returning it. Too dark to see, I Shouldnt have to turn my wrist a certain angle to tell the time!, well at first it a great looking watch out of the box weight was good movement was good it had some glitchy stuff like 40 day month and 7 week subdial. but for 30 bucks not bad, untill it stoped working after 2 hours movement was working but hands would get stuck and had to pull out crown and move them 2 hrs later same again so will be returning watch., I bought this watch Nov, 2014, wore it a couple of times. By Jan 2015 the watch had developed a mind of its own. It would work sporadically and not show an accurate time. Buyers please beware. Looks like a good watch but it really isn't. Upon close examination you can notice the flaws.<br />When I peeled the sticker from the back of the watch, I noticed the plate or emblem inside the watch was half painted/coated and had jagged edges.<br />Watch looks decent; but the quality is suspect and a far cry. Not worth more than a $20 watch.<br />Returning the watch under warranty would set you back a $20 shipping and handling fee. Not worth it for the price paid, it is absolutely worthless. Rather put it in the trash.<br />Pales in comparison to the other watches I own in the same price range. It is an absolute rip off. Stay away and spend your money wisely., The watch was fine if you were a young boy.  It is stated to be a man's watch.  It is fairly small. Over all was ok.  Just the time it took to.get it was long., My family loves Full Metal Alchemist. Both of my boys are fans. So this pocket watch set is a perfect gift item. This actually is two watches and my little guy is so excited to have his own Elric brother watch he screamed. They did an amazing job paying attention to the detail in these watches. All the way down to the remember engraving inside. These are well crafted. They are lightweight and not made of materials that will makes these watches heirlooms but they will hold up to daily use and last forever if only taken out for cosplaying. My oldest has now decided he shall be Edward Elric for Comic Con. This is a great start towards crafting his costume.<br /><br />As watches, these keep time well. They came with batteries installed and the time is easy to set. I have been checking them all week and they do not drop time at all. You really cannot beat the price either.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., This watch is a beautiful time piece, however mine arrived with the crowns threads stripped. I couldn't tighten down the crown. The watch arrived with the crown out. Poor Q.C. !  I've had to return this watch and order another one. Two stars due to aggravation., Came to me broken. No way of contacting manufacturer. Also didn't come &#34;new&#34; like it claimed and didn't even include a box. Poor customer service., The color looks completely different than shown. More like a dirty white color.. Not happy at all.. Shipping was sooner than it said so that was the only thing I liked about it, So simple. So functional. So reasonable., The primary problem is the integrated black strap.  On my wTch, it broke from wear with no way to replace it because its integrated into the watch face.  This watch, like most digital watches, keeps reasonable time, but with a broken unrepairable strap is now useless as a watch to wear on my wrist.  Needless to say that I'm very disappointed and now very leary about these single construction resin watches.<br /><br />I should also add that I've owned this watch for less than 2 years and have not worn it playing anything more agressive than golf., Ordered mine some time ago and it still is running strong. I loved that it came set to the correct time I didn't even have to set it. One issue is glass cracked on the first day., I really loved this watch but after this short a time it has quit keeping time.  I even went to a local jeweler amd had them put in a new battery which cost me $10 and it still won't keep time., Received right away and watch is as described. Very pretty! Love it!!, Nice band but I read other reviews and saved the original pins since the ones they sent were too short., Watch did not keep good time, sometimes losing 5 min. per week. Attempts to repair it via Ritz Watches (seller) did not correct the problem. I expect better when dealing with a Luminox watch., Speedy delivery! The women watch is so elegant! The champagne rose with leather brown is so beautiful, fits perfectly. I still hate those little spring loaded pins., Beautiful watch! Looks expensive. I get a lot of compliments on it. Does not keep time though. I've reset it multiple times and it still doesn't work correctly. I still wear it as a bracelet :), Stylish. Incognito. Elegant. Simple yet, fashionable. Love it, highly recommended, and brilliant idea the way time it's hidden, get yours today!!, Wristband is very small., excelente, it says waterproof, I used in the pool and when i went out the clock doesnt work any more., Had to return it because it's way to big for a child.  Don't really know how well it works because I didn't try it.  I could see it would not fit a normal size 8 year old., Cheap, Looks and feels really cheap.  You totes get what you pay for! It is still functional and works fine, I bought to use at work - I'm a medical assistant and work in a hospital setting. Broke 3 days after wearing it. The one end completely popped off. I was able to re attach it but really? Three days?, Looking to buy a decent watchband spring removal tool, I took a chance on the comparatively rather expensive Bergeon (based on previous good reviews).  Examining the business ends of this tool with a 10X loupe, all concerns regarding its cost vanished.  A genuine pleasure to behold and use such a beautiful and solid precision tool.  A quick search then of other tools by Bergeon led me to this set of their watchmakers screwdrivers.  Also wicked expensive.  But there simply cannot be better miniature screwdrivers than these.  Another example of superlative precision Swiss-made tools and instruments whose quality is unmatched anywhere on the planet  (I'm thinking here also of Sinar view cameras, the Rolex GMT, and the Hämmerli 208,—Olympic world champion .22LR sport pistol)., Beautifully made watch, arrived in perfect condition. Runs well. Impossible to read in all but the strongest, direct light. Nice wrist adornment but you can't tell time with it., Gave this as a gift and it didn't work.  How embarrassing.  Then, I spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to process an exchange.  Total pain., After receiving the LAD German watch yesterday. There was no indication of longevity of the battery. The face of the watch is nice. Good for spot checking time. Unfortunately when the battery finally goes through its life span, I for one do not have the time to look for a jewelry store to replace the battery but other than that it is a very attractive watch. For temporary use but not for an operator., The Best!, [[VIDEOID:9f12260f8b8bb920e91a8e4f1c9c5f51]] I received a sample for evaluation. All opinions are my own.      This watch is large, with approximately a 2\\\\\" face including the tip of the crown measuring to the outside of the bezel. It approximately measures 8 1/2\\\\\" inside the band. The watch is actually loose on my husband's wrists and he measures 7 1/2\\\\\" around. However, the link size is adjustable. There are 3 links on each side of the face that can be removed. Each link is approximately 12mm. I feel like I have \\\\\"large\\\\\" wrists as a woman, yet I can slide the links over my wrists without undoing the clasp. Two small flathead screwdrivers came with the watch and box set to customize the watch to a shorter length. The color of the Rosewood and ebony is deep and I think looks true as pictured. The grain of the wood is smooth on the links with a satin sheen, but the crown (the knob) on the watch has a rough finish compared to the rest of the watch. Overall, the watch is light and attractive. When the hands tick, you hear the movement. I personally did not care 100% for the sheen of the links though. I did like many other features of the watch though. I like hearing the hands on the watch tick, and that the hands on the watch are also glow-in-the-dark.    The date can be adjusted by pulling out the crown very lightly with the first pull, and turning the crown clockwise. The time can be adjusted by pulling the crown once more and can be turned in either direction.    The watch does come with a basic cardboard box and pillow to store it in or for gift giving.    UPDATED: 8/24/15.      I removed 2 links to shorten the band for my husband. There are no instructions included to do so. It's a bit tricky if you don't have steady hands.    Here is how I did it:      Two flathead screwdrivers are supposed to be included for link removal.    1) Take one flathead and insert it into the pin. I tried the pin closest to face first on the opposite side of the crown.    2) Hold one flathead screwdriver firmly in place while unscrewing the pin on the other side. If you don't see the pin loosening, then try switching sides.    3) Pull out the pin with tweezers or a needle nose plyer. Be careful of the finish. I just used my nails to remove it. The pin and screw is really small. So, I placed them in a dish while I adjust the links.    4) Fit the links back together and reinsert the pin and tighten the screw back on the other side using the same method as number 2.    I hope that helps, and makes sense. If not, I don't mind helping if you have any questions., Thank you, Very pretty watch, even prettier in person! And a great price! It's heavy-ish as others have mentioned, but not in a bad way. You can tell that it's quality. Also the picture makes it look huge, but it's actually a very nice size. It doesn't look too large or masculine in any way. I will have to have several links removed, but that isn't a big deal. I have to admit the deal was so great that I was worrying that it might be too good to be true, but the watch comes with a card of authenticity. I'm really happy with this purchase and the icing on the cake was that it arrived early!, Wrist band color not what I expected.  Nice watch, though., Cute and stylish!, Bought for a 9 year old and had taking a few lickings and keeps right on... displaying the right time... and ticking., Glass cracked very quickly, One of my favorite watches. The case and bezel are made from plastic which I wasn't expecting. Its is however perfect in size, lightweight and looks great. Put on a 22mm nato strap and now its my favorite to wear., The photo of the watch made the watch face look much bigger. I was surprised at the small size of the watch face. Also I had to buy a new battery to know if the watch even worked. Disappointed., This is one heavy watch! Out of the box it weighs 7.7 oz. You definitely know you are wearing a watch when this on your wrist and other people will too----the watch face has a 2&#34; diameter.<br /><br />It is a beautiful watch and well designed. The hour and minute hands are easier to read and the date and timer dials are small, but easy to read. It is well constructed and very functional<br /><br />If I was judging the watch on just the watch, I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />However, I received this watch for free and if I had paid for the watch I would be irritated by a couple of  things. First, this is a complicated watch and you buy it because it has a lot of functions. You would think the instruction manual would be helpful. It isn't. You don't get a model specific manual. You get a manual that contains instructions for various models of watches you need to figure out which one is yours and flip around to find it throughout the manual. If you are paying this much for a watch, you deserve your own manual.<br /><br />Also, the watch band is very large. Unless you have a very large wrist, you will need to remove a link or two and that will add cost to the watch. It would have been better if they would have included an extra link or two for people with very large wrists rather than making most people go to a jeweler to have link(s) taken out.<br /><br />So, these two factors knocked down my rating to three stars. If you want a nice big watch and the above two points don't bother you, then this would a good watch for you!, You get exactly what was advertised., I bought this watch, It's get wet and the watch is waterproof, so I need that you resolve that problem!!!!!! URGENT, I live in San Francisco and love trying new eco-friendly things. This watch is beyond awesome (39$, really?). Cute, looks hipster/SF style, still feminine, not too big. Well, I'd definitely repurchase again if I has a time machine. :) Kudos to the maker!, I've very recently got into watches and I have a few that are really nice, yet I must say that this one is my favorite. I love the look of the watch and the strap is very comfortable. I wear it very often and matches my kind of style perfectly!, I've been wearing this watch or similar Casio watches for decades.  I expect the watch to last forever but for the band to break after a few years.  This time the watch itself broke where the pin that holds the band in attaches after only two months. It just fell off my hand one day.  It's of course a ridiculously cheap watch, but as a matter of principle I wanted it repaired (or more likely replaced) under warranty. First customer service insisted this was not covered by the warranty since it was the band.  I finally had to send a photo to a supervisor to show that it was the watch not the band just to get them to &#34;consider&#34; it.  Instead they said that based on the photo  &#34;it looked like this watch has taken a heavy impact due to external force(got pulled against something)&#34; so the best they could do was to replace it at the discounted price of $10 plus tax plus 8.95 S&H -- only $5 MORE than it cost me on Amazon.  They  succeeded in saving themselves the cost of a warranty replacement, but also in getting me to switch to Timex..., perfect  fit and excellent quality, Nice clean design.  Easy to read.  Very pretty. Not so big as many other watches which is a feature I prefer!, Excellent, good afternoon and saw the clock at various prices and really interests me saw the clock on 104 dollars will be possible to improve the price is right now, Excelente, The watch itself is cute , but it came with no &#34; user manual &#34; , so you have to figure it out how it works ... Can't find a way to set the time right , at least not the minutes ( this is not my first sports watch , even had other Adias before ) , but it beats me.<br />Not such a great buy !!, Absolute junk ! do not buy, it stopped ticking after couple of hours., Exceed expectation, I didn't expect to love this watch, but I do!!  I needed a watch to wear for work that went on military time and was waterproof since I wash my hands frequently.  I saw this one and thought the color was nice so I gave it a try.  The band is a good size and can fit those with larger wrists and smaller wrists (I wear mine on the very smallest setting).  The face of the watch is also smaller than what I expected which is nice because I was afraid of it looking clunky.  The numbers are very readable at a glance.  The lavender color is nice and the silver is very pretty as well.  Looking at the pictures I thought the silver was more of a frosted silver which I wasn't that attracted to but in the video it shows that it is not.<br />Overall a very attractive watch with nice features., Cheap, An excellent watch, even a great watch if you're looking for simple, classic design, instantly readable dial, and perfect time-keeping.  And it's dirt-cheap.  I've been using these watches and their identically-priced cousins of similar design for years.<br /><br />In my experience, the battery lasts at least a year, often longer.  It is easy to replace.  For those who don't want the small trouble of battery replacement, a brand new MQ24 watch seems a reasonable alternative., Beautiful, Me feel wonderful luxury, I just received this watch and I love it. The features are exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. Easy to set following the instructions. It tells you how much energy is left stored in the capacitor by simply pressing the button at two o'clock and watching the second hand move forward by five to twenty seconds.  This gives you an approximate reading of how much kinetic energy is stored in the capacitor. Just a note the blue hands are nowhere near this vibrant in person. Inside they are almost black and outside in the sun they are dark blue. I think I'm going to get a dark navy blue leather band to put on this. Some have said this model is too thick and too big at 13 and 42 mm respectively but the window on the back that bubbles out fits comfortably in between my wrist bones and doesn't stick up too much. Overall it's a great looking watch that I would recommend., This is what I needed to repair my Casio watch. It was perfect. If my spouses's expensive Fossil ever breaks I will now be able to repair it., I love this watch. Its a respectful weight and functions very well. keeps accurate time., I selected this one as I have a small wrist. I am a retired aviator and have always owned quality Swiss watches. My Tag no longer sits snugly on the wrist. so I selected this according to my requirements. It is lightweight, elegant and precise., Verycute, 10/10 would visit 15th-century Norway again., Excellent quality!, The strip button doesn't work, it opens up and makes the watch useless. I am quite surprised and disappointed, Absolutely junk and  Amazon should not be selling such junk.<br />I threw both watches away after my skin broke out apparently due to an allergy from the watch case., Good looking watch but I don't think the metal clasp is going to last, Great kit!  Fits a huge aray of watches i.e.: Casio G-shocks, and pathfinders which have some odd sizes.  For the cost of going to the jewelers this paid for it self the first time.  Quality was okay and the tool was a big bonus to the kit., I bought two bangle bracelet wrist watches for my 101 year old mother to have in  the nursing home. She loves them and thinks they are really<br />beautiful. Best part is she does not have to wind them or worry about buckles or clips to put them on., A++++++, Did not sink with my galaxy note 4. Had to install all kinds of third party apps. The only thing that worked was the pedometer on the watch.  Then the bracket broke after having it two weeks. Very cute but not worth the headache., Although this is pretty, it's cheap and irritates the skin when worn.  It took almost a whole month to arrive., This looks much better online than in reality. The finish on the leather makes it look slick and reddish- almost plastic., [[VIDEOID:ff55c9d5a28a500394cb16766a9ddc9b]] This watch is a very nice gift that is unique not only with the design, but also with the fact that it is a wind up watch. These are hard to find now-a-days, and so it makes it very unique.<br /><br />The style is very nice, setting/adjusting the time is easy to do. Winding up takes a little getting used to, and I'm still trying to figure out how long the watch will run before it's critical to wind up again.<br /><br />So far I have noticed that it does run a tad slow, about 5 min in 24 hours. that's not too bad, but in a week's time, that's a half hour off. Pretty serious if you're a punctual person. Thus the 3 stars.<br /><br />I'm going to keep watching it and comparing it to the actual time, and see how it does over time. I'll update my review as I learn more.<br /><br />A free sample was provided in exchange for an unbiased review.<br /><br />Update 08/24/15:<br /><br />I fully wound the watch at 8am yesterday and let it go to see how long it will last on one winding. The watch completely stopped at 12:10pm today. So almost 28 hours. I'll keep checking it to see if it's consistent. On the flip side, the watch seemed to keep better time this time around, maybe it just needed to be used? I'll keep tabs on it and post an update as appropriate.<br /><br />Update 08/26/15:<br /><br />I decided to see what happens if I wind the watch every 12 hours, rather than 24+. So far, the watch keeps consistent time. I think the trick here might be to wind itKU6WN6HH twice a day rather than once a day. Yes, more work in the long run, who wants to remember to wind their watch twice a day, but so far this seems to be a good solution to keeping time without electricity., These are essential. I have two. One at cabin and one on my arm., I have a 30 year old Seiko Divers watch that I've worn probably 90 percent of the time. The watch bands come and go.  This latest one seems sturdier than I remember.  If you're installing it yourself do get excited and put it together backwards like I did.  Make sure it is oriented the way you want it (left handed or right)., Fit well, nice. Works so far , so good. A detail, the red mark in the crown y a plastic band easy lo looses., This watch was perfect gift for my husbands birthday!, My favorite straps. This item is quite known among the watch-goers. Very thick and very high quality. It is definitely expensive but it is worth the money for those who love to have high quality watches., A couple of days ago I wore it all day for the first time. I LOVED it. My watch far exceeded any expectations I had. I would recommend this watch to my friends and family!!!, I wear this watch a lot in fact I'm wearing this watch as I'm writing this review., Very beautiful, a good solid timex watch. costs a little more that some of the others, but well worth it., The winder do its work in super quiet mode and look better that the other  two winders I have same brand but in horizontaly watches position. The only thing I  love in others winders is the led lighting witch here it are not given. The sensitive  thing are the rotors witch hold the 2 watches. Here  are ok but in the other winders  was defective 3  times and the watch can jump out from the house because the cheap plastic of its. I recommend this winder and want to know why has others brands  winders  prices of 200-1000$ .They have names but do same thing.  Don t be a snob and don t touch those super priced winders ,(only for snobs) . I forgot to say the price  of 59$ witch make the winder more atractive.NOW I BOUGHT THE SECOND WINDER SAME BRAND AND NO COMPLAINS,,, Wore once quit working or never did, Cheap casus it breaks easy!, I gave this watch as a gift. My BF loved it! The watch face is bigger which is very popular right now. This watch can easily be dressed up or down. I would gift this again as a gift., Best watch I ever had for 15 dollars it's the best alternative for a G-Shock if you don't want to pay 50 dollars, great for everyday use, This watch is quite hard to see the digital dials. Other than that it has great functionality. Unless you're dead set on having white letters on black background for the digital display, I would recommend you go with a different model. I purchased this watch and the M100F to compare the two. I chose the M100F due to being able to read it.<br /><br />The other variants, while easier to see, are still difficult. I can read the digital dials at night if I stick my finger over the glass, letting the light reflect off my finger so I can read the digital dials. This trick didn't work on this watch though as the digital dials were still too dark., Very small band.  Great for small wrists, not so much for larger women., I have a G shock atomic clock solar charge to wear while working that I beat day in day out and I have synchronized the Seiko 5 to the atomic clock and so far I have lost two seconds in a week which is excellent for a Seiko 5 . the lums on this watch is one of the best I seen. The size is a classic style and a comfortable one to be honest .I find myself wearing this over the fossils and the G shock more often than not (except at work). I'm far from an expert but I know what I like and like my Seiko 5 . for my next  purchase I'm thinking a 40 mm seiko5 j1 of some sort. I'll keep this updated if need be .peace, Good knock around. Replaced a 20 yr old timex that finally quit., i got this watch as a b-day gift from my fiance and i am completely satisfied. i love the feel and the look of the watch when i wear it. the watch keeps perfect time and usually once a day i wind it. it has a nice weight to it and i get complimented over the watch nearly every time i've been out with it on. the double pins holding the strap onto the watch is extra security and just adds a feel of integrity to the watch design. i get a very clear display at night with the tritnite night glow trademark invicta has. this is my 2nd invicta watch and i plan to start collecting more now that i see first hand how well designed these watches are and importantly comfortable. -, I like the look of the watch. Found the clear back of the watch a little strange. My only concern is it may need to be worn every day. I pitched the watch mainly as a day time work watch.  During my last three day weekend I did not wear it. When I put it on for work I observed it had stopped two day prior and needed to be reset. To early to tell how accurate it keeps time. So far I have had to adjust it once. If I worked night shift I think I would go with a tritium watch but for day this watch seems to be a good choice.    UPDATE.  I have now been wearing the watch for several month.  The watch has begun to stop while being worn., Attractive looking online, and perhaps will be attractive to some people when they see it, but I found this watch to be made of cheap materials and had the appearance of such. I was excited to get it, but when I put it on I knew I couldn't wear it - this watch does not meet my standards for a quality accessory., Accurate timekeeper, clear simple watch. The one negative thing though is that after only a couple weeks on my wrist the bezel is full of scratches, so cannot give a perfect score, otherwise I like it., The watch that I got was different from the photo.  It has dark metal and dark metal chain.  Also, it doesn't keep time well.  Sometimes, it is off by an hour within 24 hours, and other times, it is off only few seconds.  For the price, it is OK., Too bulky and heavy., its amazing watch even girls think l am a rich person when they see me on the street with this watch lol, Beautiful, Nice watch: I have received several compliments on it:Love the large feel of it: Watch is somewhat heavy: but all in all, its a great item, i love my spiderman watch. it always amazes people when i press on spiderman and the time pops up, The color is simple for wear it and nice for daily use, Nice watch.  Classic round look.  Not too big, not tro small. The Glow in the dark hands are a little difficult to see at night but other than that I am very pleased., I have had this watch for five years now and feel it's time to give my feedback on my companion. It arrived in May 2009 but when I opened the box I saw that it hadn't seen daylight since February the same year. The battery indicator still showed 'High' on the dial. The user-manual is comprehensive and you'll need it if you're not used to Casio watches. If you have used a Casio watch before then you'll have no problem operating this watch.<br /><br />I have used the Casio when travelling, doing heavy work and for trekking. I have used it in situations when I didn't want to risk my other watches, so the Casio has seen a lot of heavy use. I have never abused it but I have not been overly protective either, so it has experienced a very active life. It has never failed though and has been a very dependable companion. The case is very solid and the straps shows little wear after all these years. The watch has experienced temperatures from -25 deg Celcius to +40 deg Celcius and has been exposed to water, sand and dirt, all without a hitch.<br /><br />It syncs once a day and it usually does so without problems. I live in Norway and I'm at the outer range of the radio signal of the transmitter, but that has never caused any problems. I think I only have had to perform manual sync 4-5 times a year, and that is mostly down to me leaving the watch in a drawer in a concrete basement.<br /><br />The only negative thing about the watch is the alarm. The sound is very faint and the alarm-function is of no practical value to me. I guess that the solidity comes with a cost as the solid case is affecting the sound level. The world clock function is superb though if you are travelling.<br /><br />To me the Casio is a superb watch for its use. It has many useful functions and is very comfortable on the wrist. I would be really sorry if I somehow lost it tomorrow and would buy a new one in an instant if so happened., Excellent, Didn't like it. It was way too big for me. I returned it and got a small one from the neon series. I've only had it for a day. It fits me better and so far I like it., Just beautiful.. fast shipping, Awesome watch. Was a gift for my boyfriend. Unfortunately we broke up but that's not the watch's fault., Good looking watch and keeps accurate time. Would have been 5 stars, but it does not have a screw-down as was advertised., I bought it a few years ago and didn't use it too much. It's VERY made cheaply. I recently plugged it in to use it and it doesn't work now. Into the garbage it went. Look elsewhere. Poorly made and doesn't last., I am only disappointed that I did get long ago, Looks classy and is totally quiet, It was great while it lasted!  The 10 year battery lasted less than a year.  I was also not crazy about the rigamarole you had to go through to reset the time or a function.  Other than that, it's a really nice watch for about 20 bucks., after only a few minutes the clasp broke on both of the watches that I brought., The watch is pretty big on my wrist - bigger than I was expecting from the pictures. The sensors on mine works just fine but there is some silliness to it. This should be expected -&#62; The temperature reading is affected by body temperature, so to get an ambient temp reading you have to remove the watch and put it in the environment you want to measure for 20 to 30 minutes. Why not just pick up your smart phone an get the accurate local current weather and forecast. What about the barometer and altimeter -&#62; Well if you think of a hot air balloon you realize temperature has a huge impact on air density and on instruments that measure air density like a barometer or altimeter. (Barometric air pressure drops about 1 inch of mercury per 1000 feet of altitude as you go up in altitude. And temperature has a big affect on air density too, so in aviation there is a concept of density altitude where on hot days you compare the density of a hot day atmosphere (say 100 degrees F) to a standard atmosphere day (say 59 degrees F at sea level) and you see the air is less dense and you have to accelerate to a much faster speed to take off on a hot day. The acceleration to a faster speed uses up more runway length so you have to check if you have enough runway to takeoff at all.<br />So how does all this affect the watch -&#62; If you take the watch off your wrist where it was at a temp of ~83 degrees F and move it to an ambient temp environment with different temp it is also going to experience an air density change and think it has changed altitude and barometric pressure as well. So this is how I use my watch -&#62; I don't use it to measure temps - I just leave it on my wrist so I don't expose it to the air density changes it experiences off my wrist. Then I use it to see relative changes in barometric pressure and altitude. For the barometer I watch the trend - for centuries the barometer, all by itself, has been a break through weather predicting instrument. If I am a sailor and I see the baro take a pretty fast dip I know a storm is brewing and I need to respect that and take appropriate action, etc. For the altimeter, when I go bicycling, I like to see how much relative change (going up hill and down) I have made - I know (or look up) the MSL elevation of the places I start from, and I set the watch on my wrist to the start elevation. Now I can watch pretty good relative changes in elevation I achieve going up an down hill for me as a cyclist. I like the quick reference for the moon phase and the tides as well. Like my old Red-Rider BB gun I also enjoy the compass in the stock - it works and I actually use it.<br />The watch is tough - I was about half way through working under on my wife's car putting on a receiver hitch for a bike rack before I realized I still had my watch on and was banging it around on stuff under the car. It didn't get scratched or damaged but it is not a hammer.<br />The atomic time setting works well. We live in the SE in GA far away from WWVB in Colorado. The signal strength meter in the watch works well to find a place to put the watch where it can receive the weak WWVB signal and set itself to the Bureau of Standards atomic time keeping. Mine sets every night to WWVB, and its pretty neat to have dead nuts accurate time right on your wrist.<br />So in summary - I'm a geek, and - besides real accurate time of day - the watch gives good relative readings of baro trend, altitude, moon phase, tides, and compass and it's size and impressiveness compensates well for any other personal deficiencies I may have. I really enjoy the thing, but it you want quick or accurate data (other than time of day) - pickup your smart phone.ilor and I see the baro take a pretty fast dip I know a storm is brewing and I need to respect that and take appropriate action, etc. For the altimeter, when I go bicycling, I like to see how much relative change (going up hill and down) I have made - I know (or look up) the MSL elevation of the places I start from, and I set the watch on my wrist to the start elevation.

It's a little small but it is very durable., Purchased for my 8 yr old Angels fan. Perfect for adults or children., Poor quality but that's because of its low price, Good watch for what's worth. Date/Calendar dials are a bit small and blend in the back, making it awkward to read at a glance. you really have to focus in to make them out.<br />Solid band, and material is well constructed, especially at the connecting points.<br />works well for everyday wear., it's perfect and beautiful as i thought, the watch does not work!!  I have taken it to a jeweler, and the watchmaker the watchmaker there could not get it to work with either the old battery or a new battery.  The jeweler said the watch is defective.  I would like to return it and get my money back.  How do I get my money back from Amazon?, I got it as an anniversary present for my husband.  All he said was. .momma did good! It's perfect!, I bought this watch for my 10 year old Boy Scout. He lost it and found it a year later. When he began wearing it, the battery died. I was pretty miffed since it was essentially a brand new watch and it boasts it has a 10-year battery. I replaced the battery and two months later it died. I pulled the battery out and my volt meter says the battery is fine. I put the watch back together and it works fine. For another two weeks. Cleary, their is a short within the watch. I did not get my $20 worth out of this purchase. Now I'm in the market for a replacement. Not sure I'll come back to Casio., Broke before I could even wear it., The picture does not give you a proper perspective on how large or small on your wrist., Is NOT waterproof, even at one atmosphere., Smaller than the website picture. Nice, but to small. Also I found it for less somewhere else. For lot less than what I paid here., Rapid delivery watch is vary comfatable., I like it , and the packet a rive quickly . But I haven't use it because that was a give for my daughter . And I'm not giving it to her till next 4 month .<br />But so far I like the color , I like the style . I'm happy with it . Thank you, This is a beautiful watch! I love the moving diamonds. The face practically glows!<br />I am so happy I ordered this watch!<br />Fast delivery, too!, stopped keeping correct time after the first week, making a watch useless. It was some how synched to my phone which showed the correct time but the watch would be an hour behind., I had a $650 Tissot that stopped working due to moisture....from a shower. So, I  decided to go another route, and got this Timex. It is simply a great deal. Looks good, works, and does not break from a shower! (Seriously, a shower!?!), excelent!, Very cheap., Mine was delivered a few days ago. This is an excellent watch. It's even nicer than my last Seiko 5 that I broke after 12 yrs. If there were some super popular sports star wearing and endorsing it, it would easily be 7-8x the price. Every bit as nice as an Omega or Roly. I bought mine simply because I needed a new one, but felt like it was christmas morning when I put it on. Thanks Amazon and Seiko., Very cute and classy. LOVE Skagen watches!!!, Hefty. A little on the heavy side, but you should get used to it fairly quickly. The blue colors look slightly darker in person, but also depends on the type of light and how it hits the surface of the face., Beautiful watch, It opens and closes a watch, Not much else to say., I say this as a male reviewing the item.<br /><br />I am usually not a watch person and as a kid I liked the little lcd game watches, then as I grew up I just used flip cell phones as watches, I was very utilitarian.  Then as I got older, I imagined I could do with a little class, that is where watches (and even clocks) come in.<br /><br />Before reviewing this item, I took a look at the history of Anne Klein, fashion, products and watches...very interesting history.<br /><br />I am not familiar with many things fashion related as I follow my own tastes, and women's fashion...I am that much more clueless.  But I believe this watch, this model matches my wife's tastes quite well.  The Anne Klein AK/20521VST Crystal Accented Gold Tone and Ivory Bangle Watch and Bracelet Set is truly lovely...to say the entire name is a mouthful indeed but there is one, perhaps two components of the name and description that I believe my wife would find lovely.<br /><br />My wife likes sparkly things, she often has her attention drawn to things that have many jewels...singular is one thing...but many facets catch her eye.  She will love the arrangements of the Swarovski crystals.  The gold tone of the stainless steel is also something she will appreciate.  She, as well as I, am not a fan of the very yellow \\\\\"gold\\\\\" things that are made, we like it white gold or sterling silver...this has that gentle hue of the \\\\\"gold tone\\\\\" that she will find quite nice.  The ivory tones are also quite soothing and relaxing just to observe.  The enameling finishes off the set sublimely.<br /><br />On top of the aesthetics and the quality of craftsmanship, there is a built in touch of adjustment.  Both the watch bracelet, as well as the bracelet with the link design, are designed to allow you to remove a segment that appears to be 15mm in lenghth.  Of course, the way it's designed with the clasps on both ends of this adjustment link you would have to remove the other clasp, making the adjustment about a 20mm reduction?  I am not a jewelry expert but as I measured this I was wondering how much it would actually adjust, so I hope this helps.<br /><br />A lovely watch and bracelet set for your loved one.m reduction?  I am not a jewelry expert but as I measured this I was wondering how much it would actually adjust, so I hope this helps.<br /><br />A lovely watch and bracelet set for your loved one., Wasnt exactly what I was looking for but it does what it says. Im still a bit confused on how it measures the calories and stuff but its cool., My GF was super happy with this purchase.. My wallet was not.. But its a good value compared to the stores.., The description of this watch band needs to be updated, as it does not fit all Deco 18mm watches. It's a very close match, which is frustrating because you think it would work. I ended up going to a local jewelry store to find the correct band. Overall, it is a legit Michele band, but it needs to be updated to reflect the actual watch head it aligns to., This tool has very limited usage. Most of watches have smooth cap and do not have grooves to hold on. I ordered this tool by mistake. Since it is cheap, so I did not return it., Its a beautifull watch. i like it very much, Band is cheaply made.  Can not find pins for it., The watch was a little bit more delicate than I thought it would be. The face cover is even plastic. All plastic but it does work and keep good time. The watch is far from durable., Pretty amazed that this watch has done so well. Worn at work covered in Moly grease... been hit with Brakleen and penetrating oil, showered with, taken into 6+ feet of salt water and looks almost perfect.  Crystal got a few scratches a day after I got it... -_-<br /><br />Every week or so I turn it back a few minutes, but so far the movement hasn't been slow.  Definitely considering more Seiko watches in the future., Very good looking watch very stylish it has weight to it which I love. Will find out about water proof in October when I go in a cruise to 5 different island., Never could get it connect to my phone.  Pretty watch but I'm almost deaf so I need it to vibrate when the phone rings, The watch looks so good... But the color changed on the second day :(, Watch is great except for the battery. It died after 5 days. Every time you replace the battery you have to reset the time and alarms. If I am going to be doing this every week I will look for something different., it worked, Never worked.  can't find replacement batteries either on line or in battery stores., Its a wonderfull watch., This watch purchased from authentic watch store is not cerified authentic from Tissot. There is no certificate of authenticity from Tissot for the watch.  I have an original Tissot T trend courtier automatic that my wife bought at Jared.It comes with a certificate, serial number card,  and warranty card.  The one I purchased from amazon does not.<br />  My wife also works at Jared and works with the Tissot reps directly. She brought the tissot purchased from authentic watch store to the Tissot rep and they informed my wife that the watch was not an authorized Tissot piece. They have sent the watch to their lab for investigation.<br />Also,  authentic watch store refuses to produce any documentation on how they obtain Tissot watches or provide any certification from Tissot for the watch., Cheap!, EDIT: the picture in the listing has been updated (8/16).  I raised my stars, this is a great watch  Prior review: This is just a cautionary note: the watch sold here is NOT the one in the picture.  Model H32505751 is indeed a Jazzmaster silver dial automatic, but not the black dial Jazzmaster Open Heart automatic shown here (which is model H32565735).  Search for the model #s to see the right pics., At first look the watch looks real but when you look at the back of the dial where the battery cover is you can tell the watch is fake because it does not say Michael kors on the center, but it is a nice watch, worked amazingly well!, It's a nice looking watch, but very small for a man. This was supposed to be my husbands birthday gift , but I gave it to my son instead ., Stopped ticking after one hour of opening the package !, Great watch.  I was worried about the reviews on the display being too dim and it is just fine.  The band is a little stiff so I hope that the more I wear it it loosens.  Very easy to set up and calibrate the compas.  I would recommend this product.  I also have to say that Amazon customer care center is awesome!  Had a delivery problem and they took care of it within minutes., there is no way you can purchase a more reliable, simple to set up, dependable, good looking water proof watch, with a night light, at such a give away price., I've only had this watch for a week but I suspect it will be as durable and accurate as previous Casio watches have been for me. The dial face is very legible and the band very comfortable. I bought this for an everyday knock-around watch. A great deal at $18., Amazing build quality !, The watch is so cool  but the diameter is small for me., Fit the watch perfectly, I love this watch! It's so pretty and comfortable! So pleased!, Takes a licking and keeps on ticking, I did a lot of research before buying this watch.  I was torn - should I buy a watch with automatic movement or quartz?  Will the battery be a pain in the neck to replace?  Will this watch be large enough?  Those questions were put to rest through a combination of research online (apparently this watch model has a HUGE following among the dive-watch nerds -- and I intend that term NOT to be taken disparagingly).  After receiving the watch this week and wearing it for a few days, I believe I can confidently write this review and state this watch is an incredible bargain.<br /><br />It's a very handsome piece.  The case (size-wise) is larger than my Orient Mako, and is actually more in-line with a Seiko SNZF I used to own and black is always in style.  The bezel turns easily, but not so much that it's loose or will move accidentally.  The action allows for two-clicks per minute, 120-clicks for full rotation.  The photos do this watch justice - what you see is what you get.  The finish of this watch is quite nice - belying the $45-$50 price-tag.  I would expect this level of quality on a much more expensive time-piece.<br /><br />Quartz movement.  I was concerned I would hear this watch tick-tick-ticking away the time at night.  The movement is barely audible with the watch pressed to my ear.  Now my only concern is that of the battery, and I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br /><br />The strap - at first I was worried it was a little flimsy but as I have worn it this week, I misjudged the strap; it's fine.  It's soft enough, not too plasticky, and fits well.  The watch is very comfortable to wear.  I thought I would be replacing the strap but I think I'll keep it.<br /><br />The only negative aspect is that the luminescence is a bit on the dim side, but in a completely dark room, I can see the time and it lasts all night.  I woke up a few times and was easily able to see the time.  Some people complain that it's not as bright as a Seiko SKX007 or Orient Mako or Ray models, but then again - it's not a Seiko or Orient watch, and costs about 1/3 of the price of the Seiko and 1/2 the price of an Orient.  And here's a little secret I have yet to read/hear from any Seiko or Orient watch owners - Seiko's and Orient's luminescence seem to be very strong coming in from the sunshine or being under a light, but after a few minutes, they get dimmer too, and eventually (e.g., during the night when your kids wake you or you need a drink of water) the luminescence of the Seiko and Orient are on-par with this Casio.<br /><br />The crown - I have never owned a true dive watch before with screw-down crown.  It took a little getting-used to, and it's great because the screw-down action keeps me from messing with the time and trying to get it to be as &#34;right&#34; as possible.  The crown-guards are also appropriately sized and keep the crown from snagging on anything, which I appreciate since I have worn this to work with long-sleeved shirts.<br /><br />I'm definitely not a watch collector.  I HAD (past tense) a Seiko 5 SNZF-15 watch for about 18 months.  The lack of accuracy drove me NUTS.  I wore g-shock watches (which I have subsequently sold or passed on - digital is not my thing) and tried probably a half-dozen other styles before coming back to this simple design.  No alarms.  Water resistant.  Rugged.  Dependable.  Dual purpose - it looks good worn with casual clothes as well as business., It was a gift for my husband, he thought it was fabulous, Simple, attractive, very legible, go anywhere design is torpedoed by its bracelet and lug design.<br /><br />The watch is the right size (midsize) at 46mm and is a very good looking piece.  All the finishes are pleasant, with the satin, sand-blasted bracelet and case really drawing you in.  The dial is well marked and easy to read at a glance in strong or low light.  Water resistance rating of 200 meters, backed up by a screw-down crown makes it fully functional.  The clasp is a very cool spring-loaded butterfly that works beautifully.<br /><br />What's the rub?  First, it's sizing the thing.  There are no half-links or 2/3 links to mix and match with the full links, so your adjustment increments are about 4mm.  Lame.  Either you're cutting off your circulation or the thing is flopping around on your wrist like a bangle.  Ultra lame.  Then there's the absurd height of the lugs.  What looks like a flexible first link is actually rigid and part of the lugs.  It makes the lugs ridiculously tall and the watch even more uncomfortable.<br /><br />Had high hopes for this one.  Second Swiss Legend I've tried and the second total failure.  No more.  Interesting when you consider that they (SWI)also make Red Line; four of which I've purchased and enjoy regularly..., Just what I wanted!, battery die, Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, it appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.<br /><br />First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the &#34;full&#34; price, and even the &#34;sale&#34; prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that, had it worked when it arrived, it would have been an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought two other watches from Heritor in the $100-$150 range (marked, allegedly, &#34;80-90% off&#34;), and they both, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.<br /><br />The following is based off my experience with one of the other, similar model Heritor watches that arrived in working order, and may or may not be 100% accurate for this particular watch:<br /><br />The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate. Heritor's website provides more specific mechanical details of each model, but you really can't trace the movement to any particular make of any particular notoriety. The Day of Week and Day of Month complications (in the watches that have them) appear to legitimately function, although the Month indicator is manually advanced at best. The Automatic winding wheel works as advertised as well. The watch face does have a quality look to it, although some of Heritor's designs and colorations can be gaudy or difficult to read. The leather watch bands they come with are garbage, but replaceable--while they do appear to use genuine leather on the outside, the layer is thin, and thickness is given by a middle layer of foam. This makes it brittle enough to not withstand years or even months of buckling and unbuckling. If you like the band, wear it until it breaks, then replace it, otherwise just replace it right away with a metal band. I would not expect this watch to be durable. Don't wear it in the shower, or drop it, or wear it while working on things where you might be banging it up against things. If you think you can take good care of it though, and you enjoy wearing and looking at a mechanical skeleton watch, you may get your money's worth at least... but seeing as how you can't afford a Rolex now, I wouldn't expect you'll be able to afford one when this wears out or breaks, either., The watch is a nice looking watch and fits my wrist well after removing three of the links.  My problem is primarily with the luminated dial.  It's terrible.  The hands do not illuminate and because the dial does, it is impossible to read the watch in dark conditions.  If you don't care about that, it's a nice watch., Already wrote a review. I love this watch!! Thanks, The watch came today and it works perfectly. All the settings work and it is new out of the box. I have no problems with the watch. It is better to buy this watch on Amazon then the official G-Shock store or other stores because it is way cheaper than retail price! Almost a $60 bargain! Anyways, it is perfect and works perfectly. (May update if any problems occur. If no update, then it means I am still a happy person! :) )  P.S. For those of you who want to know, the watch came inside the original G-Shock case with an instruction packet and a warranty card. There is foam padding inside the case., The watch looks amazin i want to really get one, Everything I was looking for in a watch! I priced Seiko's at my local jewler and was not able to afford the $400-500 prices. I went on Amazon to see what I could find in my budget and was blown away when I found this $495 watch for less than $150!!!! And add to that, it was exactly everything I wanted in a watch. I love the white ceramic, the stainless steel with gold accents, the sparkly diamonds, the solar battery that will never have to be replaced, the size is stylish and not overly big, I could go on and on!!, Really Solid Watch, you can't  go wrong with this, the person i gave it to love it especially the removable link to adjust the watch bracelet, In less than a month one of the bulbs flickers in and out. In 4 months time the time battery (not the light battery) went out. I cannot find on the inside where the &#34;normal&#34; battery is. So, now it's just a fancy flashlight.<br /><br />Other than that, I've had lots of good compliments on it. Shame I can't get it to tell time anymore., Gorgeous. Super-readable., Cool watch. Love the led display. Arrived as described. No instructions but I figured it out., None, excelente, Simple and accurate. I like it., I like the softness and regular length.  In the stores I can only find long length, stiff bands...so I'm happy., After 2 days of use, and taking the watch off only twice, the clasp broke. Extremely disappointed., Really nice watch. I get compliments when I wear it and it's really affordable too compared to other watches I've seen online., The Casio watch arrived with one band separated.  The pin holding it had come loose and was easily fixed.  The size and style are very nice.  The white of the face is very white while the band is more of an off white color.  I've worn it to the pool for water aerobics several times.  My only slight complaint is that the hands are a little difficult to read when not wearing my glasses in the water.  I wished they had more contrast.  Over all, I'm satisfied with this purchase., I absolutely love my Seiko clock., Love my Invicta my 3rd bout to order another soon, Nice looking watch but not the best quality. Links are very hard to take out and when i received it the battery was dead. Looks good but kinda irritated that I have to buy a new battery just to enjoy it, I use to pay 45.00 at my local mall to get my watches adjusted. Thanks to this I can do it from home, it only takes a few minutes., The watch is definitely beautiful. I am pleased with my purchase and will update my review as time goes by., works perfectly for what I needed it for, and easy to use!, He loved the gift and wears it everyday! He so deserved to have such a great gift! He is truly blessed in many ways! The watch is incredible! Quick delivery and exactly what he wanted., Had many Ironman watches, this may be the best, Very pretty watch, the band is nicer than I expected., I am surprised about the quality of this product. This is a steal compared to other leather straps out there. I'm planning to buy another one for extra as i prespirate a lot and damage the leather most of the time. I just hope that the price won't change, Excellent price for this high quality Ball watch, it's got a very clean and elegant look. The band is quite comfortable. Delivered promptly and well packaged., Excelente, Fantastic, I absolutely love this watch. I have very small wrists and it was extremely easy to adjust. Very classy look., It's comfortable, good looking and does the trick for me. 4 stars is just a personal thing w/ getting used to the white (and wearing a watch)., reminds me of the first watch my dad bought me. Con is that it doesn't light up !, It's really big..and there is no way to adjust it, Perfect!, I love this watch.  I am a nurse and I needed something water proof.  This watch served the purpose and it was big enough to see the hands on it.  It can take a licking and it keeps on ticking!  I got mine in pink., Most wrist time pieces come with black band, but I prefer brown leather. Band looks great., Cool clock, Love the color and feel. It matched the photos online and the quality is as good as I expected. So far, happy with purchase., love the watch and many compliments.  worth every penny, Not worth the money. Did not last 6months.  Winding dial broke and clasp gave way., I wish they would list the size of the face., Looks nice I really like it., Nice size, easy to use, and a comfortable strap., The watchface was a little bigger than expected but still a solid buy., This a very handsome watch. It's rugged and has many features such as 60 and 30 second timing and it water proof. This watch is designed for left handed people, but I guess right handed people could wear it too! The watch is very  also large for those who have vision issues. This is truly a beautiful timepiece., SYNOKE SN-35933 Women's Casual Fashion Watch (Golden + White)  FOR REVIEW<br /><br />OK this is a better idea,  water resistant easy to operate and low cost well worth trying out while under harsh work environment, After the first Moto 360 battery went haywire (full discharge in less than an hour, too hot to touch, repeated after factory reset) Amazon was quick to replace it. The second one lasted about 75 days before issues arose. The back is cracked in 2 places even though I have taken the utmost care of the watch, and the battery occasionally dies in &#60;5 hours. This is pretty much throwaway beta technology for now. Wish I would have waited., Okay, so full disclaimer: I didn't buy this through Amazon, and when it arrived, one of the three I ordered appeared to have been previously opened, and didn't work, so consider this review accordingly.<br /><br />First let me say that, as you probably can already tell, the MSRP on this watch is hilariously inflated, part of the oldest marketing trick in the book to make you think you're getting value on a sale price. I seriously doubt anyone's ever bought one for the &#34;full&#34; price, and even the &#34;sale&#34; prices should be considered suspicious. I paid roughly 10% of the MSRP through an online clearinghouse, and all things considered I believe that it was an okay deal given the price I paid. I bought a total of three watches from Heritor, paying in the $120-$170 range (marked, allegedly, &#34;80-90% off&#34; their respective fake prices), and while one arrived broken, the other two, so far, seem to have been decent buys for the money. Mechanical watches aren't cheap, and Automatic Skeleton watches even less so. There is very little middle ground between worthless crackerjack box plastic knockoffs, and a Rolex that costs more than a used car and you put in your will. Obviously, you're not looking at this watch if you can afford to drop several grand on a Rolex, so be that as it may, this may be a watch worth considering for you.<br /><br />The movement is a fairly standard inline lever escapement from China (although Heritor claims that the movement from at least SOME of their watches comes from Japan), and so far (having worn one for a few days) seems reasonably reliable and accurate.

This watch is very large, but overall likeable., They seem a little cheap but so far working acceptable.  The case is flimsy and its easy for the different sizes to get mixed., It works., I don't believe that this is a seiko band.  It doesn't say seiko on the buckle like all of the other bands I've bought.  Second, it didn't come packaged like the picture.  Third, it didn't have the spring pins.<br />Not happy!, Worked great for about 6 months...then the second hand literally just fell off, and it obviously quit keeping time., Just what I wanted. I happy with this watch, I Love this watch two. It is real pretty two. I would like another one.I got the other one yesterday. Thank You so much., I think we received a fake watch from Amazon.com.  The watch does not have 2 clicks on crown which adjusts the day and date.  It only adjusts the time, so, the three small subdails are not working at all. Also, the pink bezel can not be rotated, it is fixed.  We checked the back side of the watch, it indicates &#34;Cased in China&#34;, but the amazon side indicates that it is made in USA and imported.  Also, no warranty card in the box.  Just feel that this is not a real watch.  Return it if you bought., The watch fell apart after 2 days., Glock 19 started life with a 7# typical glock trigger.  Installed this kit with all spring and the trigger would not reset the trigger safety.  Put the glock factory trigger spring back in and the trigger is wonderful.  3# 9oz consistently.  Little after travel as that is adjustable by filing a metal stop on the connector.  Short take up and little to no creep.  Reset is crisp and audible.  Very happy with this setup., I just received this watch band.  It was a bit pricey, but it is worth the money. It has a lot of heft, and is thick leather.  The pins and band itself were a bit too wide to fit into my Swiss Army Watch, but I resolved that by just using my old pins (the originals from when I purchased the watch) and snipping off a bit from the band.  Overall, it's a great band.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because where the clasp is, it's a bit bulky.  But I knew that because I had read previous reviews.  If you want a good quality band that looks like it's going to last a long time, get this.  It also comes with an extra band which holds the excess of the band around the wrist - I don't know the name of the piece, but you get an extra one in case., Gave the watch to hubby on our anniversary!<br />Cute watch, looks great! He set the time and noticed it has a crack in the face. Just went to return and I'm out the 30 day return policy (ordered early and held for anniversary). Boo., The overall look of this watch is very nice, eyecatching and higher end than it is for the price.  The problems:  The band is made for someone with a 6.75&#34; wrist and SMALLER.  I mean for a large-face watch this should fit up to at least a 7&#34; wrist with room. I think they did not want to give you the extra links that you normally get when you buy watches because this is a cheap watch.  I usually remove links on all the watches I buy, but I buy high-end watches normally.  Also, it says 'Rubberized&#34; well my mistake was thinking that that meant that the band would be more 'silicone' and flexible. There is NOTHING flexible about this band at all.  It feels like you're wearing a matte ceramic band- it's a hard band, hard links. I LOVE the matte look of this- that is why I bought it and the large face is cool, and the rose trim but other than that... dislike. I just needed one more link in the bracelet and it would not be tight on my wrist.  I'm going to purchase a cheap silicone band and swap it out, perhaps a white band or something in a generic silicone cheap band., The dial is really black unless you put a high powered light on it., It's too heavy to control it,but it's very nice.<br />Thanks., Nice looking watch, oversized is an understatement, I love big watches so if that's what you want then that is what you get here. The band fits my big wrist just fine...we'll see how long it holds up., Great battery and working well in my watch, but shipping was more expensive then the actual battery., I have not been able set watch yet.  I am not sure it is working correctly!, The watch did arrive on time in new condition so this review is nothing against the merchant. Timex really messed up on the design of this watch.<br />First, the watch's second hand is pure black and extremely difficult to read even when the Indiglo light is activated. Secondly, the watch came with incomplete instructions. The fly-back chronograph was properly documented but there was no documentation available for the E6B slide rule functions (nothing available Timex's website either). Fortunately, I'm a pilot and already know how to use an E6B so at first the lack of instructions was not a deal-breaker for me. The deal-breaker was when I noticed that the slide rule markings are incorrect and that even if you know how to use the slide rule it will yield incorrect answers! I decided to return this watch., One word...... AMAZING!!, I was not pleased at all. If I would of known that I could not send an item back. I would not of ordered this item. I have learn a valuable lesson. Now I have a watch that I will not use. And another thing if you are going to send an item like this. Perhaps, it could come with English directions., Huge watch! It looks amazing and does tell good time. It is brighter and bigger than the picture depicts so if you don't want a huge watch, then this isn't for you. But as for me, this is the best. Its a little to big for my had so i had to remove a few links. Walking down the street it attract a lot of eyes. It is brighter and bigger than the picture depicts so if you don't want a huge watch, then this isn't for you. But as for me, this is the best., perfect birthday gift for my fiancé, it's even better in person then the pictures! Great quality., excellent, Love it! looks beautiful on my wrist !! perfect for everyday!, Withaut worlds!, I use it for my SEIKO orange monster.  Works as described., This watch has an appeal on my wrist that I can easily match my wardrobe.  Keeps accurate time without too many dials., Thank you, The watch is really nice but the diameter is 40mm and no way on earth its 43 or 44 and I don't know how you guys measure ! Anyway I was going to return it but a guy bought it from me :D, I am very happy with this watch. It was working right out of the box… great it needs no battery! It is a bracelet  type of watch and is beautiful with all the bling around the crystal. I have a large wrist and it fit beautifully with even a little room to spare, so as not to be snug. If you do have a small or medium wrist you will most likely have to take it to a jeweler to have it sized down., Very nice looking watch, but the interior dials are extremely small and difficult to read., Imo it looked cheap so it was quickly returned., Thought it would be better quality., I bought this watch as a gift to myself with my bonus check in 2013 and am still very satisfied with it. It has so far been a very durable watch that has gone with me into the wilderness of my home in Alaska to staying strapped on my wrist for weeks straight of backpacking through Portugal and Spain in 100 degree weather. You cannot ask for a more comfortable (and so far for two years durable) watch without going digital. Really wish I had this watch back when I was a scout.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />*The watch is a modest 40mm size making it comfortable for daily wear and lightweight since you the bezel is aluminum and the band is nylon.<br />*The face is very legible with white text on a green background and convenient date window at 4'clock and luminous hands, but note no luminous markers.<br />*The movement it runs on is pretty simple, one YouTube tutorial and you'll be a wiz at adjusting and using the chronograph. (Mine came with the chronograph hands resetting to the wrong positions everytime, so I watched a video and learned how simple it is to adjust the chronograph on the movement it uses so it reset properly.) Also it's a modern ETA movement so it can do elapsed time on the chronograph. This means that if you stop the chronograph with the reset pusher (bottom pusher) it stops the hands so you can view them, but it keeps the chronograph going in the background so if you hit the reset pusher again it will speed ahead from where you stopped it to where it is the second time you pressed it, this is very helpful for timing laps. Sure a digital stop watch records times and can list them for you, but that's the price you pay for being traditional and cool, a little bit of mental math. It's still a feature worth mentioning that not all movements incorporate.<br />*Can't really say much about its water resistance except it survives washing the dishes and salmon fishing, but I'll just assume it's good to 100m as that is pretty standard.<br /><br />The cons: (for meanyways)<br />*The chronograph operates wonderfully, but back when I purchased this watch it was advertised as having an hour chronograph dial, in the picture you can clearly see it has 1/10 of a second, realtime, and a 30min totalizer, but I wasn't smart enough at the time to notice that it was a 1/10 of a second dial and not an 10 hour dial (which I thought was pretty weird in the first place that it was 10 hours and not 12, but just figured it was a size thing since this isn't a ginormous watch). If you don't need hours on your chronograph then it's not even a con, but for me it was a bit of a con because I was expecting an hour dial (I had never heard of a 1/10th of a second dial before this watch, but I suppose I could see it's uses, stI'll wish it was an hour dial though) It works great, but if you want to time more than 30 mins you have to do mental math and pay attention to how many 30 minute segments have passed.<br />*The green paint on the bezel can get scratched off a little on the edge, but it's not a huge deal for me since this is my daily wear, utility watch for non-formal occasions.<br />*The lens isn't sapphire like some watches in the price range and most that are above, it's mineral crystal and can get scratched up a bit. The lens is strong and I have no doubt in its durability, it just shows scratches more than scratch resistant sapphire, again it's my utility watch so it's not a major let down.<br />*The band can suck sometimes if it gets wet since its cloth. It's nylon so it dries pretty quick, but it still gets absorbed and can be a little annoying. It's still worth it in my opinion though because I like the military look, it looks very similar to a standard green NATO watch band, only major difference being that the stainless steel buckle on the factory band has a neat Victorinox shield etched into it. Some people say the watch band is dinky, but mine has lasted two years of work and adventure. I'm a groundskeeper and a fisherman, so I frequently get my watch caught in nets at both jobs and it's never snapped, in fact the top pin that holds the band onto the case just came our undamaged. The pins appear to be spring-loaded and just pop back into place. Luckily the button pin stayed in otherwise I might have lost the watch. If the band concerns you I'd imagine at standard green NATO nylon band would fit fine this watch fine.<br />*The lumination on the hands doesn't last much longer than 30 mins, leading me to believe it's not aged tritium, but they still are very bright when they are freshly charged with natural or artificial light. Also the hands are polished stainless steel skeleton hands with large white ends, so it really isn't ever hard to read unless you're in complete darkness or have some serous cataracts.<br /><br />Overall this is a great no-nonsense, authentic, Swiss watch with just a few cons that are probably due to this watch being relatively affordable. If you don't need hours for your chronograph and want a comfortable watch that matches the cool green military jacket that you probably have because you saw the picture like me and thought the same thing, then this is the classic, rugged watch for you! (And yes it does match my army green jacket nicely.), Could use a larger wrist band for larger people., love this watch  its simple,face is the right size if you are looking for a some what large face ., Item was exactly as advertised & was delivered in the time as advertised.<br />I was happily surprised., I have this watch clipped inside my golf bag out of the weather. It has kept me on time for the tee time and the 15 min per hole time limit., My previous watch, another Tissot, lasted 20 years until it died a few weeks ago.  Perhaps I should have had it repaired.  This new watch is fine as a piece of jewellery (shiny, pretty) but not so good for telling the time.  The problem is it is very hard to read in many lighting conditions.  The hands are almost the same shade as the watch face and the watch face itself has a very strong reflection of light sources.  The end result is one has to peer at the watch to determine the time!  Not very practical., Bah ha  Timex sure dropped the ball here. the idego light stopped after about a month  I wore it until the band broke and them i got a Casio  which so far seems ok., Incredible value for $300~  Rivals watches costing 4x its value, Superb watch, in every way.  Everything about the look of it oozes quality.  The finishes, polished in some places, brushed in others, are exquisite.  The bezel turns smoothly and ratchets positively.  The manual wind and hack functions work perfectly.  Mine is consistently 5-6 seconds fast per day, which is well within spec.  The lume (the glow in the dark hands and hour markers) is awesome!  This is a serious dive watch, but I'll admit that I'm not a diver, and don't intend to be.  I bought this watch for two reasons: I think it is the most readable-at-a-glance of any Seiko, and it has the 8L35 movement, borrowed from the much more expensive Grand Seiko line of watches.  It replaces a perfectly good Casio Mudman G-Shock digital watch, which I had been wearing for nearly 10 years.  That watch still works as well as it did 10 years ago, but my eyes don't.  For the last few years I've had to get out my reading glasses to read the time.  With this watch I can tell the time with or without my reading glasses, and in any light.  Are there any cons at all?  Well, the watch is quite heavy, as you'd expect a large, solid stainless steel watch (and band) to be.  Many people say that even as heavy as it is, with a little time &#34;it disappears on your wrist.&#34;  Yep, it does, until you move your wrist, and then you're instantly aware that you're swinging some weight around.  I don't find it unpleasant.  It's also fairly thick, at 15.3mm, and it looks downright chunky on your wrist.  Strangely, although it appears thicker than the Casio I replaced, it's actually almost 2mm thinner.  Must be the bright stainless vs. black rubber.<br /><br />Finally, and I almost hate to bring this up, there are unexpected intangibles that make me like this watch even more.  Pride of ownership?  Perhaps.  I like the feeling I get when I look at it and see the perfect fit and finish.  I love the second hand that steps 8 times a second, appearing to move very smoothly.  I love the clever bandextension built into the clasp, allowing you to quickly let out the band to fit over a wetsuit.  And of course, I love being able to read it, day or night, with our without my glasses.  It does exactly what I wanted, and looks far more elegant than I expected.  This is a fabulous watch., Dead on arrival. Extremely disappointed., Like this watch very much, I''ve given it as a gift., Excelent, Perfect size! Fits well and I get so many compliments,, I didn't love this watch in person. I ordered this and the gold tiny gramercy and will be keeping that one. This one didn't feel as comfortable and didn't look as good., Worst ever!!! Ordered these for a man (as they were &#34;men's watches&#34; and got 3!! NOT 5 as said and completely floral watches...my grandmother wouldn't even wear this crap!!! I'd give negative stars if I could!!, This is a pretty solid watch. Be warned, it's a pretty heavy watch. On a watch this size with a metal band, the band will sort of balance the weight on your wrist. This watch, with the nylon band, is heavy to one side because the band is so light. So, it always wants to spin around my wrist. I could probably stop this by wearing the watch a little tighter. This may not be a problem if you're used to big watches with nylon or leather bands. I haven't had a watch without a metal band for many years, so it's taking some adjustment on my part. For those of you with large wrists, the band is nice and long. I have about 9&#34; wrists,and I use the second hole on the band. I can get it to the 3rd hole, but then it's a little tighter than I prefer. The only other thing I wish this had is the date. I miss that on a daily basis. Those minor gripes aside, I really like this watch. The numbers/hands are easy to read. I use this watch as my daily wear watch for work. I've knocked it around a little bit, and it still isn't showing any scratches or dings. The only spot where there is any evidence of wear, is on the buckle and the bars that retain the tail of the band., Perfect., Beautiful watch, but I will have to remove extra links for it to fit properly on my wrist., The band appeared to be extra small  I was very disappointed., I'm very happy with this product. I needed one that would fit the newer bigger watches now being sold. Seems to be well made. The times that I have used it, there has been no problems., Now THIS is a watch!....<br />It sports Classic good looks, is multifunctional, has quality Swiss quartz movements, water resistant to 330 feet, scratch resistant mineral crystal lens, Luminous markings, fully adjustable rose/gold colored stainless steel band with push button release, date/day function, tachymeter bezel ect.<br />This is truly a fine timepiece, and the heft alone tells you it is a serious time keeper... as this one has some weight to it.<br />The Swiss Legend World Timer is perfect for the frequent flyer, as it can easily adjust to any time zone in the world .... and when seconds count, you can count on the Swiss Legend to track them all with absolute accuracy as the watch has a very easy to use chronograph/stopwatch with sub-dials that measures time down to 1/10th of a second.<br />This is a battery powered timepiece... so no need to worry about when or how much to wind, just set it & forget it.<br />After removing a few links to get a proper fit... I was very impressed with the fit, feel and look of this watch ..... It looks so good that once you put it on, it is hard to take off...<br />so whether it is a night on the town or a business trip out of town... this watch fits both roles equally well.<br />Time is your most valuable commodity... and managing your time effectively is of prime importance, as once time is wasted, it is gone forever & you have nothing to show for it....<br />So it behooves us all to keep a watch-full eye on our expenditures of time... lest we run out of it ;)<br />But I digress....<br />The Swiss Legend World Timer watch IS indeed a great watch... but there are a few things that are worth mentioning... such as the luminosity factor is not the best, not easy at all to read it in the dark.<br />And the weight could be a &#34;turn off&#34; to some I guess... but I think it just makes it more appealing myself.<br />The World Timer comes with a 5 year warranty ...that's pretty impressive.. as it suggests they have great deal of confidence in their product...<br />All in all ... the World Timer gets 4 out of five stars....the fact that it is hard to read in the dark accounts for the loss of one star, as that is one of the attributes most fine watches enjoy...<br />But for the price, there is no room to complain... as it IS competitively priced.mer gets 4 out of five stars....the fact that it is hard to read in the dark accounts for the loss of one star, as that is one of the attributes most fine watches enjoy... But for the price, there is no room to complain... as it IS competitively priced., It's a little too green!, Boght two of them and they both got stolen!, This is a sophisticated beautiful watch case winder.  It is also priced fairly and wilt dissapoint., should have been in a holder case. easy to loose tools if not in a case...thanks,,, 👍🏻, Don't buy this watch if you are a train conductor, commercial diver, or astronaut. If you do not fall into this category, you should buy this. This watch is the cheapest watch I have ever purchased, yet it has garnered the most compliments. Someone will mention the watch weekly, and the price is almost low enough to where it wouldn't be crazy to just take it off and give it them rather than try to explain how to find it on Amazon. In terms of reliability. This watched ran for 6 months, got smashed to pieces (my bad) and STILL continued working until the batteries finally quit. Excuse me while I go buy this watch again now., Smaller watch face than I expected but works very well underwater like it supposed to. Used it underwater for snorkeling and at the beach for several days however the white silicone band started to slightly turn yellow after a few days. Can't expect much for the cheap price but works nonetheless, Engine/main spring had a major failure.  Watch is no longer usable after about 3 years of use.  Beautiful watch and somewhat fun while it lasted but don't expect it to last too long.  Engine isn't reputable., I own a number of luxury watches. This Frederique Constant Carree looks and feels like a luxury watch costing 10 times more. The fit and finish is outstanding and defies the low price investment. Many of my friends have made positive comment on the watch. The movement of this piece is high quality and matches many of the higher priced look-alikes. I wear this watch when dressing up for special occasions., I like this watch...its awesome. but i need to return this its too big for me.in my wrist., After only owning for a little over a month it gas tarnished and turns my wife's wrist green when worn. Very dissapointed., Last week, I received the watch and astonished!!<br />The watch is very good, it has the value of over US100dollars.<br />I would like to recommend it to all who hopes to buy the sports watchs.<br />Please enjoy it., omg I have absolutely no idea how to put the watch on!!! It's really pretty though, Stopped working, Owned it for less than a year and the indiglo stopped working. Amazon will not allow a return or replacement., Love this watch. Large face, easy to read. Nice band., BEAUTIFUL WATCH!!!! Only had the white one a day before I made an &#34;impulse&#34; buy and purchased one in black too, but with the diamonds that encrust the entire face!!! The watch is heavy as noted by several other reviewers, but that being said, will only make it that much more sturdy if you choose this as an everyday watch.  It's blingy enough to be worn as a dressier watch yet is absolutely perfect for everyday wear too!! It's a phenomenal watch for the price. I paid well over what I spent on these 2 watches put together when I had purchased my diamond Bulova watch several years ago but sadly my Bulova has no where NEAR the durability of these watches!!! I recommend this watch for both durability, looks and quality of workmanship!!, very quiet - easy to use - wish the operating light was on more often when not turning, but not worth a star deduction - keeps my automatic wound when I'm not wearing it, this watch is simply amazing, not only is it water resistant but you can wear it with pretty much anything. i encourage you all to try it out, you wont be disappointed. what are you waiting for order now. if i could describe it in one word it would be AWESOME!!!, Had the watch for about 6mths when the button functions stopped working. Contacted Amazon, the Seller and the Manufacturer and they all pasted the buck to the next guy and basically won't stand by a product the sell/make and told me to take it to a local watch repair shop. I won't buy another watch from any of them and am highly disappointed in Amazon through the whole thing. Don't waste your $$$. 6mth life, CRAP., It's awesome good quality leather strap the clock is nice as well, Wow I love this watch if you don't like them heavy this one is not for you. Awesome, It's a cool watch but the analog already feel out when I was putting on my jacket. I only had it for a week before that happened., Very pleased with this purchase., Did not last the season., Great solid feel.  Definitely would recommend.  I used this beautiful endmill bracelet on my SKX007K2 which I put in place of the stock jubilee bracelet that comes with the SKX007K2.  Best choice ever.  This bracelet and watch together is a completely different presentation and feel.  If you prefer the jubilee I would recommend the aftermarket jubilee bracelet as the stock bracelet is too light and the appearance shows it., Working great. Love it. The band is a bit itchy and the watch feels a bit heavy. But once into a run, I'm fine. By the way, all watches feel the same way, so it's not just this one. I just hate stuff on my body when I'm working out. So many features for such a little price. This is, by the way, my third Ironman Timex. The first two survived seven Ironman tris and numerous marathons. Great product. I just wish it was a bit more comfortable and somehow weighed less. But still...worthy of 5 stars and then some. Thanks TIMEX!!, Its a great looking watch and I really like the image of Mickey. Since visiting Disney World a few years ago, I have become a huge supporter because of the work that Disney has done with the animals, providing them with the habitat and caring for them as if they were in the wild. I was also impressed by the way they administer the park in general, a real first class operation. The watch is done in the same way. Clear and sharp image and a classic stainless case make it a joy to wear., Leather band is kind of stiff at first but then loosens up after a while and becomes more comfortable, Very nice watch.  I was impressed with its quality.  It was a gift for my boyfriend who I'd consider to be a picky person and I really think he liked it.  Would recommend., Great size to have:  Not a huge face dial as some other watches I've purchased. Excellent overall quality and everything works perfectly. Came to me with the date and time set for eastern time. Came with protective bezel plastic cover.  Watch has given me NO problems and the watch has not had to be adjusted.  The small dials are functioning and reset as they should. I would buy this watch again., Its supposed i have a set of three watches but i received just one ., I have this watch but slightly different version of colors...I received it has a gift about 3 years ago and let me tell you this watch can take a beating. It's been shot with paintballs, while paint balling I've gotten hit a couple times in the hand directly at the watch and it continued on. I work loss prevention and the watch continued to withstand abuse even after knocking it off brick walls and glass while fighting with shoplifters. I've gone swimming with it in the ocean, pool and shower and it still keeps trucking. I take it to the range and basically any athletic activity or dirty work I can count on it! This watch is outstanding the ruggadnesss of it! If your looking for a watch to take abuse like a champ. Buy this one!, Ok, I did not get this watch on Amazon, but wish I did since the price was better.  This review is concerning the quality of the watch.<br /><br />When I bought this watch it was in a display case and not running, I wound it and checked the functions and 'rough' accuracy against my atomic watch for a few minutes before buying it.  The watch has a good heavy weight and durable genuine leather band which I LOVE.  My atomic watch is without a band because I got tried of replacing cheap resin bands.  I have another that has a stainless steel band which is more durable, but less comfortable.  Therefore, the soft but durable leather band was a big plus for me.  The Watch is rated at 50 m/ 165ft water resistance but I don't swim or shower with it.  It has gotten wet from sink faucet and rain without any issues.<br /><br />The only issue I have had with the watch was that after a hour i started noticing it was running a few seconds fast.  Of course, by the end of the day it would have gotten a lot further off.  I saw on another review here where a user was claiming the watch kept bad time too.  However, I'm guessing they didn't even consider that the watch may need recalibration.  So long as a mechanical watch is functioning and not broken or damaged, it should be able to keep very accurate time, this goes for any of them.  I removed the back cover and tapped the regulator lever very slightly counter-clockwise to slow it down and let it run for another hour.  It was then about a second slow.  I then lightly tapped the lever very very slightly clockwise and let it run for a few hours after syncing it again with my atomic watch.  After 3 hours it was still second-per-second in tune with my atomic watch so I re-installed the cover.  After this calibration the watch seems to loose about a second every other day, which is very good to me.  For those that don't want to go inside the watch and try calibrating it yourself, I believe most jewelery stores will do it for you.<br /><br/>** Tips for all mechanical watches **<br />Tip:  It's the balance wheel lever pointing towards the blue screw.  The other (larger) lever is the amplitude lever that regulates how 'much' of a swing the wheel goes through and should not be messed with.<br /><br />Tip until you calibrate:  If you know your watch is off roughly by a number of seconds, set the watch HALF that the other way in the morning and it will keep more accurate time throughout the day than if you set it exactly on time in the morning.<br /><br />For example:  Watch is 5 seconds fast over the day:  Set it approximately 2.5 seconds SLOW.  As the watch speeds up over the day it will approach being on time, then at the end of the day will be about 2.5 seconds fast roughly.<br />Conversely, if the watch is 5 seconds slow over the day:  Set it approximately 2.5 seconds FAST.  As the watch slows down over the day it will approach being on time, then at the end of the day will be about 2.5 seconds slow roughly., Reliable., This is a very nicely made kids watch.  It fits my 7yo daughter's wrist perfectly.  I like that it is water resistant (says 30m, but the button style makes me question that).  My daughter already knows how to read an analog watch, so she really wanted a digital one.<br /><br />I received this in exchange for my honest review., Just a little small print for my older eyes., I have had this watch about two weeks.  I love it and would highly recommend its purchase. Its absoulte accuracy, large display, and cool appearance are  my reasons for the 5 stars. I have had no problem with the length of the strap (have an inch and half to spare). One of my best purchases of late. Of course time will tell if all this praise is warranted.  &#34;Handsome is as handsome does&#34;., I bought this watch at here.<br />but it doesn't work.<br />Is it no battery inside or what happen?, It works! It keeps time well, and I have gotten comments from my friends that watch anime that it looks really good and that they wanted one themselves. It has a lot of detail, up to the writing on the inside of the watch. However, the clasp holding the watch closed has a tendency to get stuck open. Also, the roman numeral 4 is written wrong (IIII instead of IV). Overall, I will need to make another purchase with this group again to see if all of their items has little oversights like this or mine was just five degrees off of great, it is smallish, low quality., There was no spare blade in spare blade container.  Blister card says there are some in it., There were no spare blade in spare blade container, Very beautiful, I like this watch so much!  but this kind of watch's belt is easy dirty, so this is a problem for me., Back to basics. Really basic. Great looking. Simple alarm - kinda wish there was a different alarm sound. It sounds like every other alarm out there including my husband's., Absolutely A Beautiful Watch!! I couldn't be Happier with this Purchase!!!, Just what I was looking for. Actually nicer looking than I expected. The blue and grey combination work well for casual to work. I've written it in the pool and no problems with water. Fits well on my wrist, band is comfortable., The white face and the white hands make it very confusing to tell time, the hand and face just blend together, I love being able to replace my own pins in  my watch. This is so much better than paying $10 for each broken pin at the shop., It seems a bit small for my wrist. I have it only 1 hole left on the band. Also seems like it's missing a button. I mean you can do everything you need to do, but the light button on the upper left is a multi function button that also controls the stopwatch and could have been a separate button on the top right., Watch broke within 2 days. Also it couldn't even keep the time right., It's still ticking till now (22nd Aug 2015). Can't complain much about this taking into consideration of the price!, Within 12 hours of owning this product, the band broke which is a huge disappointment, for the price the band shouldn't be such poor quality, The quality is seriously missing on this product. The lining that is connecting the glass to the velvet was already peeled back in places when I received it. The glass top slams shut way too easily (no weighted hinge). The bottom drawer does not slide in smoothly. Due to the friction of sliding the drawer, the black faux leather material disintegrates and cakes the top of my dresser with a fine black powdery substance. I am worried that this material from the poor construction will get on to the grey/cream colored interior and look terrible.<br /><br />Cheap cheap cheap.. you get what you pay for I guess., You never have to do anything with this watch after initial set-up. Keeps time within a second or two of official world time. Updates automatically while you sleep. Adjusting the wrist band on this watch is very tedious. There has got to be a better design for wrist band adjustment. Also, removing 3 links was just a little too tight, but removing 2 links left the band a little too loose., Smaller than anticipated and it was cheap looking wasn't pleased at all, super comfortable, no flash, just looks real sharp, my go to watch right now. highly recommend., Fits perfect light weight great watch but I feel like this brand asks too much $ for what it is, My husband gave me this watch some years ago and I lost it last year, after much searching I found it here I am the happiest person right now. I purchased it for my birthday in March couldn't be a better gift to myself. Won't loose it again, very elegantly designed., Bought this watch for work since my fossil was to heavy. I have to say that this watch is light and and comfortable. The green color is the coolest thing about the watch. I was going to buy yellow or red color but glad that I bought green., Just as expected.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  Thank you., Awesome looking watch and definitely love the atomic time keeping and solar powered., It tells time. It goes on your wrist. It has 24 hour mode, and alternate time zone mode. I'm a simple guy who just needs to tell time. It works great and I like the simple utility of it., Buy this watch for the second time. Someone bought the first one right off my hands. Its classy and simple perfect for a everyday watch, The watch is great just too bad the battery gave up within 4 months of purchase., I'm still trying to get the analog and digital times to be the same. It works and I like the bulky look. I just got it so I'll see how it works for the next few days., Always love Casio watches, Came on time but expected brand new watch. Was scratched up. Very disappointed!!!!!, Simple sleek and a great color. I only wish it had a date display but then that might have taken away from overall look so very happy with it. I have other Kenneth Cole watches and for the price they are extremely well designed and always reliable., This watch is awesome! I am a pre-nursing student and got this watch so I can use it at the hospital. It's got a 24 hour clock and has the date. It's waterproof and works very well, plus it's aesthetically pleasing. I took it with me while vacationing in Hawaii, swam with it several times in the salty Ocean and it still works! I love it!, Nice watch but huge.If you do not like big watches,this is not for you. Not easy to tell the time but i still like it., Awesome sleek watch only down side is the rubber band holders on the band both broke off and before they broke off they kept sliding off. I fixed it with two small pieces of electrical tape., Purchased for my husband.  He likes it OK except has had difficulty with having the correct date come up.  The &#34;military time&#34; would be a big advantage for some people.  The face is easy to read and the band is comfortable for him., So beautiful and elegant watch. A very good buy. Very happy!, Perfect clean slick watch for either everyday ware or even a night out on the town watch! Love it's all black design because black goes with everything and it's touch screen adds a cool different feature that separately from the rest, This watch is essentially a copy of a Casio watch in look, feel and functions. This is appropriate for little kids and juniors who just need a functional watch to tell time, have an alarm, have a light function for evenings, and a stopwatch for various activities including sports. The build quality is on par with the mid-end Casios, which I am very familiar with as even Casios are made in China these days (except the super high end ones). The silicone feels soft and everything about this watch feels very good. The only thing you don't get with this is a brand name recognition, but that could be a good thing for little kids.<br /><br />A sample was provided., I purchased this watch for an after Christmas gift. It is really solid and substantial, and with the Seiko movement, it should last for a long time., Amazing! Highly recommended. Nice, sleek design and beautiful feel to the silicone! Perfect for swimming and water-activities., Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend to store all of his nice watches. He loves it! The carbon fiber pattern gives it a very upscale look.  Feels sturdy and the hinges don't creak when opening and closing. The storage compartments vary in size so it can fit multiple styles. Highly recommended., So far it's a good watch. I've only had it 2 days. Beautiful design for the money.<br /><br />2nd review: I've only worn it two times. Bottom button must be broken! Can not change the settings at all! Would love a refund but it states it's to late. Beautiful watch, but it's hard for it to keep accurate time. Always having to adjust!<br />As for the second watch I bought. Same thing, does not keep accurat time either. Either to slow or to fast!<br />Is their any possible way for replacement or refund?, The woefully inadequate instruction manual is absurdly ridicules. Recommend manufacture hire a native English speaker to write the instruction manual so that English readers can properly learn how to use this potentially useful tool., Love the new design! The writing is large and clear. Excellent for old eyes! Primary differences between this and the old Timex Ironman is that the programming buttons are in a different configuration. There is a learning curve involved. Also there is no hourly chime or at least I can't find it. Overall, it's a positive improvement on design. And hey, its a Timex so I know it's reliable!, excelent product!, For 12 bucks and free 2 day delivery you can't beat it, I got this watch for my birthday and I'm in love. I'm 17 with average proportions, not a land whale nor a stick, and it is just a tad too loose so I'm going to have to buy one of those kits to take in the band size. So if you are a petite woman I suggest buying one with your watch because it is likely be a bit loose.<br />Besides that I love it!!!!!<br />Took a few minutes to set it because directions did not come with it, but I looked them up on Fossil's website. It's on PDF page number 9, heading &#34;MULTIFUNCTION&#34; and subheading &#34;Multifunction 6P27 / 6P29 / 6P77 / 6P79 / VX3NE&#34;. Hope that helps because it took me forever to figure out which one was for which.<br />All in all 100% would recommend (and a big plus is it is way cheaper here on Amazon HOLLA)., this watch is disappointing. The light stopped flashing after only two uses. The watch is cute but I bought it for the flashing feature., watch band is very poor quality i need to change but i don'y know where to buy, Beautiful watch!  Very happy!, A++, Excelent product & quality!, This Swiss Legend men's watch is an outstanding time piece. But it's not for those who prefer a small or thin watch. This watch is big and heavy. Nevertheless, it fits smoothly and comfortably on my wrist. I really don't notice it's girth any more than I notice my Movado.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend is a very well made watch. Upon close examination it is clear that each part has been carefully engineered and precisely machined. The function of all the component actions is flawless. I am especially impressed by the heavy band and latch. A pinch is all it takes to unlatch the band and yet it stays perfectly secure on your wrist until  you're ready to take it off.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly attractive, precision made, intricate time piece that you will enjoy and admire. Amazon's price on this watch is an exceptional bargain as well., Ordered this watch band for a friend. He loves it fits just perfect., This is a great looking watch. When I first received it, the analog portion was non-functional due to a dead battery(this watch runs on 2 batteries, one for the digital and one for analog portions). Amazon was quick to exchange the product for free, and the new watch came in 100% working condition. The design really stands out and looks really cool. This watch also has a glow functionality for use in the dark! It's a pretty big and heavy watch, so keep that in mind when purchasing. I have thin wrists and it still looks great!, I have bought two Timex and one Armitron watch in the past, neither were atomic watches. The kept time well, but the resin band broke on all three. I decided it would be a good idea to go with a metal band this time.  My dad had bought this watch in 2012 and so far the band had not broken and it worked perfectly. I purchased it as well, and I love it. The band is held together with metal pins that must be removed to adjust the size of the band. I was able to take out these pins without too much trouble., Its working properly and have a nice size. Unfortunately is a bit difficult sometimes see the hands due its color., Awesome watch! It is durable, pretty and fits my tiny wrist. I work in EMS and I beat it up pretty good, it still is scratch free. The digital numbers are hard to read but nothing that particularly bothers me, Cheap but gets the job done., Very good watch it's been almost a year since I bought it and I must say it still looks brand new. Thanks, I'm very impressed with the watch itself. It feels heavy and high quality. The glass back is SUPER cool, you can see everything. What's even better is you don't have to risk scratching up that back to replace the battery. The only con I can see for some people with the watch part is that it is sure does tick quite a lot, six ticks per second from what I've read in other reviews. I haven't worn it to work yet, but if I'm alone in my office it might be monotonous.<br /><br />The band, however, is another story. First of all, it's black, and no one should ever wear black professionally unless you're a mortician. Parts of the mechanics are gold, so it really doesn't match. It arrived with some kind of sticky coating on it, getting on my fingers, even. I knew from the reviews and similar products, regardless of color, I wouldn't want this band. I ordered a genuine brown leather band at the same time and it looks stunning, but that's aside from this product so I had to knock a star off., ° I've had it for over two years. It's now a paperweight, the strap broke without warning or provocation one month after the warranty expired. Still trying to find a replacement but it's impossible to find. I find this a rip-off and an insult to buyers!<br />° The watch is quite uncomfortable for topside use (heavy, won't fit under a standard shirt cuff) and the strap is hard. It is also not fit for diving by cause of the delicate aluminum bezel face and scratch prone case, unless you plan to keep it under your wetsuit cuff or glove gauntlet.<br />° The crown guard which doubles as bezel lock is the most stupid feature I've seen in a dive watch. I wonder how Mr. Cassell, the designer, boasts of enviable experience and cannot design a practical dive watch. The lock is impossible to open with a gloved hand so you must either enter the water with it open or put your gloves after setting the start of dive time.<br />° The lume plus tritium markings that initially atracted me to this piece are next to unusable. The lume is the cheapest I've seen in a watch over $1000 and fades away after 5 minutes, the hands lack lume paint, just tritium tubes and the bezel 0 marking is next to microscopic. Night diving? Bah!<br />° Look somewhere else for a diving piece!, This watch is gorgeous, people think I paid anywhere from $300-$500 for it!, Cool, Awsome protection....love it, The strap feels really cheap, but the watch itself looks nice. It's pretty light, and for the price you pay for it, it's definitely worth it., Used for Apple Watch 38mm. Only complaint is that my wrists are small and I am fascinated on the laaaast ring, but no fault of the product. Will buy more straps from this brand! no concerns about security of the watch face... I did have to buy the adaptor clips for the Apple Watch to use this band., Absolutly love this watch.  It's light, sturdy, and it is really easy to read in the dark.  Wear it in the shower all the time and no problems at all.  Very comfortable., Di not like it hard to set it, Its a pretty watch, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the strings that you use to tighten or loosen the watch hang funny and start to get really annoying. But if you have no problem with strings randomly rubbing your arm or getting wet when you wash your hands then you'll love this watch!, I am not an individual to write reviews, as I don't feel it necessary to convey my personal opinion to the subjective audience, however, this is a dully-noted exception.<br />To begin, this watch is mechanically, artistically, and pragmatically superior to any timepiece I have seen on the market. It's allure in design suggests an auto-enthusiasts timepiece similar to that of the nameless AUTODROMO 'STRADALE'. In that, the red secondhand/face contributes to the design of the tachometer of an automobile/ motorcycle. The blackface is subtle and sleek, humble enough to blend into everyday life routines but pronounced enough to be noticed in the romantic moments. The face takes an intellectual perception to read properly at first, but it becomes natural after a day or two. Mechanically, this watch is silent, even in comparison to my CLYDA automatique from Paris (repaired by local ROLEX timekeepers), there is no match. To add to this, the practicality of this watch is a bonus. I imagined this watch to be worn solely at functions, meetings, casual get togethers, but the sheer compactness and feather-like-weight of this timepiece has slipped into bed with me at night unnoticed many times. I have immediately been praised for it amongst my acquaintances within two days of ownership. I highly encourage and recommend this to the men from all walks of life as it has the ingenuity for a common man but the luxuriousness fit for a king., Very easy to bump the buttons and reset things compared to other similar watches and it is impossible (as far as I know) to turn off the hourly chime.  Setting things does not work the same way as other 4 button watches and the watch did not come with a manual., I received my watch in two days. I put it on and is very comfortable. This watch is a steal for only this price., This watch is comfortable.  Works well.  I can't see the smaller wheels but the time is clear.  It doesn't clash with anything I wear., To be honest, I was taken in by the deep discount...paying $100 for a $500 watch.  Wow.  But if I had seen it in a store for a $100, I probably would not have bought it.  It's just a bit too clunky.  The bracelet is noisy.  But it is pretty., I've been wearing the Bertucci titanium field watch for a couple weeks now and have been really enjoying the seemingly weightlessness feel of this watch.The nylon strap is surprisingly very comfortable, and Can be adjusted to a perfect length to lay nicely under the two metal loops without having some extra flapping piece at the end to deal with.My wrist are average size I guess but with the ability to slide the body of the watch back and forth it's easy to find the right length and balance to fit any size I would imagine. The watch itself has gained about a min. In 2 weeks.I can live with that. The tan color of the hands and markers really blend smoothly with tan slightly gold shimmer of the band. The face is a little darker than expected but the luminous hands make up for it . I find it to be a understated yet handsome field watch, which is exactly what I wanted.Buy one, I'm sure you'll enjoy it., Another mistake by a seller. They gave this description for this watch--but the picture was for a totally different &#34;Pulsar Solar, silver faced, metal bracelet, chronograph watch. This started an agonizing series of phone calls--to Amazon--who recognized the conflicting description of a &#34;Pulsar Solar Watch with Brown Leather Band and the posted picture of the watch I described above. Finally, I was given the Seller's customer service number. I talked with several staff members and they finally admitted that they had really screwed up! I told a gal there I wanted the watch that was pictured--the Pulsar Solar Chronograph Watch with Metal Bracelet. She called to the warehouse supplier and told me &#34;It was available.&#34; I ordered it at that point. I received it within a normal time span. I opened the box to find the Pulsar Silver Faced Metal Bracelet Chronograph! I was happy! I put it in my window to charge it! There was however, no manual in the plastic Pulsar box!  When I took the watch from my window sill, I read the dial to find that it wasn't a &#34;PULSAR SOLAR,&#34; but a  'PULSAR QUARTZ CHRONOGRAPH!!!&#34; I called back to the seller and was offered a 50% reduction in price--if I would keep it. I took there offer! It has turned out to be a very accurate Pulsar Chronograph! It's a handsome watch and I'm quite happy wiith my savings. Pulsar is made by Seiko and consequentl,y the quality is very high. I called Seiko and was able to print a manual out online. It's complicated to set the chronograph functions up correctly but, after this is accomplished, it is very  accurate chronograph and timepiece., Very nice Very good invicta watch. Solid and heavy. I love this watch for weight and  blue dial ocean and chrome silver case/bracelet. The button adjust clock is very solid, i feel that in my finger when i turn it!, Bought this watch for my son and he really likes it.  Perfect size for him, The Chinese bargain version of the German bargain version of the Swiss watch you've always wanted.<br /><br />All kidding aside, this watch requires the fewest bitten sheckels, and the least financial risk, for this style of watch. The automatic works as you could reasonably expect. The style is spot on, and gorgeous. Steel blue hands off axis, black straight on, print the perfect clone. Movement visible on the back, sapphire and stainless. Checks the requirements for a watch thrice the cost and half the value. Only real complaint is the size of the band: quality is acceptable and as genuine as a c bill allows, but the sizing is clearly not adequate, even for my rather mediocre wrist.<br /><br />Also, complaints concerning the crown didn't match my experience: stamped definitively &#34;R&#34; in my case. Really seems to be a very rare high value, low (relative) cost piece; a fine example of the best global ingenuity and manufacture has to offer with regards to consumer goods., A beautiful watch! I especially loved that when I set the digital time the analog automatically set itself!, This is a birthday gift, and when I opened the box to make sure all was ok, I really wanted to keep it for myself, lol. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go back on line and buy me one !., Exactly what I wanted, The use of the term &#34;Unisex&#34; for this watch in my opinion is misleading. The size of the watch face on a small woman's wrist is large. On my wife's wrist, the timepiece looks like a clown watch -- like oversized shoes a circus clown would wear. On my wrist it looks more suited for someone like myself (6' 0&#34; and she's ~ 5'5&#34;) with a slight build. So be aware of this when purchasing for a smaller male or female friend., love this watch, this is my third one in 15 years, glad the still make same model, I have had this watch for just over six years now and there is only one major complaint that I can make: the watch band is not the greatest (but how can one complain for the price?). I almost lost this watch because the watch band loop broke one day. It did not go through any abuse; once the loop breaks on this watch, it becomes easy for the watch to come off ones arm. Other than that, this watch has been enjoyable and is easy to read., Love this watch. The only downside comes from me having colorblindness. Makes the numbers a little hard to see in lower light unfortunately., This watchband more than met my expectations.  It fit well and was simple to install.  For the price, it was a good buy.  The shipping cost though was high almost doubling the cost of the watchband.  That was disappointing., This watch was a gift for my husband. He loves watches and has many different kinds. Really liked the style and roughness look of this watch. When I received it is feels a bit flimsy-cheap. Looks good on his wrist and he was happy with the watch.  Recommend this watch as a watch for kids or to have the look of rugged. Don't think I would trust it to perform in a stress test of nature., Love it! Light weight, easy to read and it lights up. Perfect for working outside., I really like the design, the details are very nice and make you looks very cool, woman or man can use that will look great with them! :))) ! AW things are incredible!!!, Beautiful looking watch . I was quite disappointed on receiving the product to see it was not working as it should have . From dropping time to eventually not working at all within 2 days of getting the watch and me not wearing it once ., Looks cheap, quality does not match the picture., This is a great looking watch, and though I've only had it for a day, it feels super-substantial. Easy to set, well-packaged, fairly thin (but not thin). I hardly need any of the chronometer features, but they do look cool and they work. Very comfortable strap, too., Did not like this particular GShock, it was hard to read without pushing the backlight button., I'm happy with that choice!, Not like the picture.  The previous band I had ordered from Amazon did look like this picture (but brown), but it was no longer available.  This band has a buckle and 3 metal rings, but the picture, and my preference, has only 2.  I did not find any use for the extra ring and its extra layer of material cluttering up the band, so I cut away the extra material with the attached ring.  Now it looks like the picture, and it works.  The rings are rectangular, not rounded nicely as in the pic and the previous band, and the material is closer to 1 mm than the previous 1.5 mm, but this band is usable and looks OK., It's a cheap poorly made product save you money and buy an Invicta, No instructions included, too bulky in size, digital display not clear., Excellent, I've had this watch for about 2 weeks now and it's the best watch ever, I get endless compliments. I was worried about it not fitting my very tiny wrist but to my surprise it did, I just used the last hole and it is a tiny bit loose but that just gives me room for slight movement. Also many people complained about the time and dates being off. I haven't had any issues with that, I set the days of the week in Spanish along with the numerical day and it has not changed at all. All you have to do is pay attention when setting it you'll see that it uses military time when setting, so when you put it to the correct day and time it does not change back. Over all best cheapest watch I've ever owned., Well beware of the numbers. The numbers shown here look very clear and not digital. When you get it the numbers are more digital looking and somewhat blurry. I was disappointed. The rest of the watch is fine. Just don't expect the numbers to look like it does here., The design is delightful, the band is made of quality leather, and so far the watch keeps perfect time. The low score is because the first watch did not work at all. Quickly a replacement was sent., Thin plastic inlay around face of watch came unglued 5 minutes after removing from box. I would think it's just bad luck, but this is the second Timex sports watch (different models) I've bought with this defect. It's only cosmetic, but I've had enough of poor quality assurance Timex; won't buy another watch from them., Nice looking, easy to operate, does the job, blue light can be turned on or off, has variable options for movement. Good purchase!, It broke in just a few weeks. My son loved it though., So far it's been a good watch. I've only had it a few days. I do not like the watch band so probably will get another one for it. The band it's self is very stiff and kind of cheap. But for the price, I can't complain.<br />If I have any problems with it, I'll update., With the right tools, you could replace the strap yourself. Excellent quality & a genuine product!, Large enough for old eyes as well as atractive, This was a gift to my wife. She really likes it., Perfect!!, Delivered Very Fast from the UK., I bought this for my mother, and she really liked it. It is a bit bigger than I expected it to be, nonetheless, it's beautiful. It has three buckles that you can switch to fit your wrist size - which she thought was very cool. It looks very luxurious, and I don't think you can beat it at that price., I love the watch itself, but unfortunately, it does not hold up for what i ordered it for.  I ordered it, expecting to be able to use it's bluetooth functioonality to connect with my phone.  unfortunately, having the latest version of software for my Galaxy Note means i'm unable to use the watch for the bluetooth purposes.  i'm still patiently waiting for Casio to get on the ball and upgrade their software, but my patience is wearing thin.  If you have android 5.0 or higher on your galaxy phones, do not buy this if you're hoping to use the bluetooth functionality., just cheap looking, I am looking for a thin watch on Amazon but it seems that manufacturers are being very creative with their product dimensions. See photos. This watch is almost 10.5mm thick yet the web description touts its thickness as 3.5mm.  No instructions came with the watch, but I did manage to figure out how it operates without them.  One of its 3-dials acts as a 24-hr indicator while the other two dials act as a stop watch. One pushbutton on the side starts-stops the stopwatch while the other resets it. On the watch that I received the reset button did not return the dial to zero, but as the photo shows it reset to about 22minutes and 27seconds.  Also it seemed to me that the main minute hand was bowed and not straight causing it to barely miss the second hand as it passed over it.  I have asked the supplier to accept its return.  Update 8/28:  Supplier credited my card for the purchase and fixed the info on Amazon's web page. Prompt and responsible actions . Since they did not want the watch back I decided to try it.  However I was surprised to see that it had stopped working. So into the trash can., Hamilton is no longer an American company and hasn't been for quite some time. They are owned by the Swatch group and are now made in Switzerland. They make a fantastic watch., Nice watch!  Band fits very well and very comfortable on the wrist.  Great shipping -- arrived very quickly., it is excellent, The watch really is a disappointment.  Please don't waste your money.  The band looks nothing like as nice as the picture.  It's cheap as can be and the clasp is too.  I am going to cut the leather (???) strips away and try to salvage something from this unfortunate purchase by using a bracelet band.  So far, the watch is running...........I will give it that.  It also took FOREVER to come; if the listing mentioned China, I missed that, but that's where it was mailed from., It's so pretty! I like this one!, Amazing, I'm disappointed!  Cannot set anything.  Spent too much time fiddeling with it, Not so elegant. Lil cheapy looking because of the paper watch face, the low quality crystals and pleather band. But Hey, I got what I paid for., I am 14 and I have a small wrist. I bought it and the quality is great and it looks amazing. But it was a bit big, so I had to poke a hole for my right size. Other than that, it's awesome!, As advertised., Beautiful watch. This is gonna make someone happy., I decided to buy a wooden watch for my father as a gift for the holidays, because it seemed to me to be an unusual but very cool material to make watches from. I'm happy to report that the watch was of a high quality and very beautiful., This combination watch and bangles is a very attractive set. My wife has very thin arms and finds most watches and bracelets don't fit her well. These did. This is not fine jewelry, but much better than average every-day jewelry. The watch, in particular is very nice and attractive. it is packaged in an attractive box set - suitable for gift giving., I am a watch lover. I have  Rolexes, Tudors, and Tags. I recently discovered these watches when shopping for my wife. I could not believe the incredible quality and value that Seiko is offering.  A true stainless steel, mechanical, automatic watch at this price! It is simply unbelievable.  But believe it...it's true.  I ordered the SNK809 with black strap. OK...the strap is not great.  You can have fun by adding a Hirsch or a NATO.  After this experience, I learned more and bought the Seiko SARB033 for myself. Seiko is incredible. The Japanese made watches are beautifuly designed and constructed. The SNK809 looks better... and IS a better watch than most of what is currently available under $500.00 At this price, buy this watch and have fun with it!, I love this watch! It's tiny, simple, classic, and perfect. It's exactly what I've been looking for. Thank you Amazon for such an awesome price too!, Everything looks great on the sales pitch and website but after having to get tow of these things that don't work I am done and sorry t have left Garmin products I am going back,..the text thing is not text it is email format ..and the watch kept overheating on me and shutting down yes we are<br />105+ but Garmin never did that to me once...the battery goes dead on 4-5 hrs and all is lost..and it took 10 min to download one run to<br />Strava...needs more R& D ..and take time to let real test runners to use it before selling ....<br />Many thanks to Amazon I am covered ...Timex customer  support is the worst sat on hold 30 min total two times and hung up on by someone<br />when they got mad at me for asking her to repeat herself accent was very bad and she told me she did not understand watch so she had to learn it while she was on phone with me ....Really this is Timex ??? what a joke<br />Garmin take me back sorry I left ya :}, It wasn't as nice as in the picture.  Also, I had a difficult time finding a comfortable position on my wrist.  The holes where at an odd distance for my wrist., i bought it for a christmas present, I love being able to fix my own watch. This is so much better than paying $20-$30 at the shop., I just love the color. I bought this watch because I wanted a watch that can be fully submerged in water, and so far it works great. I need to figure out how to turn off the alarm... but other than that setup was easy., It is a decent looking watch.  Not my thing anymore so I would not buy again., Wow..it looks great!!!The band is a bit lighter than expected, but is very thick and rugged. A note on the band says that the it will get darker as the leather ages. I might occasionally switch the band for black one to match with my outfit, but the entire watch is of very high quality. I have gotten a lot of compliments since the very first day..I will buy one for my son..the thing looks like it could last for decades. It feels like it too. A definite buy.., Shipping was very fast, I'm so glad to be a prime member. They have not let me down. The product was as promised and as advertised. I'm very pleased, I got this for my son, who loves orange.  It's almost a little scarlet-ish orange, but he didn't mind.  He has very skinny wrists for a 15 year old, and this watch does not look too big on him.  He wears it all the time, and uses the alarm to wake  up in the morning.  He's had it for about 8 months, and so far no problems., I never thought of timex as anything other than a dependable watch.  This is a very nice timepiece that I will wear daily for years to come., Looks very cheep not correctly operating, My son loves this watch! He's 8 and this is his first big-kid watch.  It looks very tough.  It has a stopwatch, date, and time, and also a light feature. He's outside as we speak using it in the dark.  It adjusts well to wrist size,<br /><br />I liked that it was easy to set the time without pulling out my hair in distress.  I'm hoping it will be a bedtime incentive since he loves telling me the time. When I say it's 9:00 pm, time for bed, I'm sure he'll check to see if I'm right.<br /><br />Another cool thing is it comes in a round tin, a collectible like the Fossil tins.  He put it next to his bed for when he takes it off.  We're very pleased.<br /><br />I rec'd this as a sample for review and inspection at no charge., This is the watch I wear everyday.  Why: the classic look, the simplicity, and the durability.  Plus if I lose the watch, I can replace it easily enough., This watch is fantastic., It's adorable but arrived broken 😂, This watch looks very nice in the photos, but it's amazing in person.  It looks like a much much nicer watch in person.  This particular model is more or less for lefties, or those who wear watches for lefties, and it's huge.<br /><br />So it looks great; it's for lefties; and it's huge.  It's somehow more than that.  It wears the enormous size rather well.  It's not garish or cartoonish, and it's well proportioned.  The functions are feel are good, and while I'm more of a automatic/self wind kind of guy, but this quartz guy has won me over.  It's just that nice., I've been eyeing this watch for awhile and was happy when it went on sale. Upon receiving it, however, I discovered a major design flaw. Unlike most watches, this one does not have an extra little band to hold the end of the watch strap in place. So, because i have small wrists, the end of the strap sticks out in a most unflattering way. :( (See attached photo). I thought about tying a string or putting an elastic band, but I don't think I could deal with that aesthetically. So back it goes., didn't fit, This little piece allowed me to continue to use a favorite watch. Measured my band and ordered accordingly. Fits perfect., I am a seiko watch wearer for 40 plus years. I felt it time to try a solar watch since I'm getting tired of replacing the batteries. Could not have picked a nicer looking watch! It has a bigger face- for me, it's  much easier to read. Can wear for a dress up event as well as casual jeans and boots. I have a small wrist 6inches and it was no problem for a watch person to adjust for me., The Wheels Are Way To Narrow Thay Won't Fit Any Of My Freight Cars Going To Return Them., Extremely difficult  to understand alarm setting and back time instructions, still can't figure it out. Not the sellers issue. Directions suck, This is the second one of these winders I have bought. The first one has been running well for years.<br />I have owned this one for 2 months and it's a piece of junk and grinds all the time.<br />Unfortunately it is out of the return period...Into the trash...Waste of $40.<br />My advice...spend a bit more money and get a higher quality winder., Very pretty watch but it did not work. I exchanged it and the second one didn't work either. I was very disappointed because I love the look of this watch., This is an inexpensive wrist watch with a huge face.  It keeps accurate time and also displays the date (but not the day of the week).  It has a hard-to-use chronograph as well.  The use of the crown to set the time and date is not intuitive.  For example you have to set the date to yesterday's date in order to have it show today's date.  It also makes a ticking sound.<br /><br />It is apparently designed to be worn on the right wrist by left-handed people as the crown and chronograph buttons are on the left side of the watch.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend company is not really Swiss; I believe their watches are assembled in Asia., i love the color and I get lots of compliments.  It is easy to read even without my glasses., I love my new watch and so does everybody else. Looking foward to getting me anothr one real soon , Ill be looking for a big face watch something I can wear to work everyday<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH, Luminox is a trusted brand. this watch is very light. I hardly notice it on my wrist. Seems sturdy., perfect size, Face is too small - deceiving photo, Easy to match with any colors and very stylish., Awesome watch! Just what I was looking for!, The watch, while lovely, was difficult to readjust the wristband and when readjusted, the clasp didn't fasten.  I am returning it., Everything I was looking for. It's comfortable and keeps accurate time. It's not fancy but it is very well made., AWESOME!, Absolutely not water resistant.  Had this watch 5 days and filled with water from a shower!!!, Love this MK watch!!! Nice size, looks very expensive and I get a lot of compliments every time I wear it out.  Value for the price :), I bought this watch in June specifically for summer camp, but began wearing it on arrival. It's held up through all my summer adventures, been submerged in water too many times to count, up mountains, down rivers, etc. The only reason it doesn't have five stars is the fact that the plastic scratched fairly quickly, but it's not something I mind. I'll be wearing these watches until the end of time!, It says the size on the site before you purchase it. My nephew enjoy the product., Gorgeous watch on a budget!!, Everything you've read about this watch is true. It's beautiful., for an inexpensive watch, it looks very classy, It broke within the first 72 hours of owning it.  I really liked it; however, it was obviously poorly made., It is a beautiful watch but the face is too thick for my wrist, I am returning & exchange for a different watch. Thank you., I was worried about spending $20+ for an alarm clock, but this one is worth it. The arms and legs move, and it's a good size for a LEGO alarm clock. The only cons are that sometimes the head (that also pushed down for a light up) feels like it may fall off, and that the alarm sound is a straight up beep instead of Star Wars themed music., I like...because Design of watch is so unique!! different! Really reasonable with PRICE also!, I just bought this watch a few days week ago. It is a beautiful watch . The pictures on the web do it absolutely no justice to its shine. I gave it a 5 stare, Bought this watch which delivered July 14, 2015. It stopped running several times and went dead completely August 22.  After August 14, it's no longer eligible for return. Worthless, total waste of money., It is a pretty decent watch.  Still runs after a few battery replacements.  I have turned into an automatic watch enthusiast at this point in time...  This means I would probably not buy this watch again because of my desire for automatics but if that doesn't matter to you as a buyer, go for this watch., WOW!!! WOW!!! WOW!!!<br /><br />Did I happen to mention, WOW! This is really a very nice watch. The features on it are simply amazing and I don't even think I have discovered all of them yet. The look of the watch is really something else. Very nice and it gets noticed a lot! I have received numerous compliments and people asking me if they could look at it, so it is obviously an attention getting timepiece and will surely get you noticed in a crowd. Well, at least the watch will get noticed.<br /><br />Now the very first thing that you absolutely need to do is read and follow the instruction manual to the letter in order to set-up and maintain your new watch. DON'T under any circumstances try and get everything set up without first reading the instruction manual. You will make some costly mistakes if you do and you could damage the watch and void the warranty. However, if you take your time and read the directions you should have no problem getting the watch set and understand how to use all of its features.<br /><br />This is a stainless steel watch and it is a bit on the large side and not one that is going to be unobtrusive by any stretch of the imagination. I have only had this watch for a few days and have already determined that I am not going to be wearing it on a daily basis, but more for special occasions and events rather than a daily timepiece. I did wear it all day for the first couple of days and I swear that I lost feeling in my left arm a time or two from the shear weight of this watch. Not really complaining mind you, simply commenting.<br /><br />Very impressed and highly recommended!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's., Almost feel like am not wearing a watch..., Simply elegant!!!, It's a watch., This watch was perfect. It's stylish and it's for a low price. You cant get a watch this nice for the price as this one., I ordered on Tuesday and it arrived on Friday, from US to IE. That was so IMPRESSIVE. I love the combination: Amazon + DHL.<br /><br />The watch is fantastic. Heavy and sleek, simply gorgeous., Very high-quality  piece, Looks good on your wrist and the moveable bezel lets everybody know it's a diver's watch. Bezel gets stiff and tuff to spin with buildup of oil and grime from daily non-diving use. It can lose a few minutes of time over the course of a week or 2-- but I use my cell phone time if I need precise time daily and ALWAYS sync my watch time if I'm depending on it. I wouldn't go for a dive without first checking to be sure my tanks were full; I check my watch accuracy if I'm counting on it no matter who made it and how much it cost. But only 4 stars because I think Seiko could do better in that department for this watch., I received the 1st watch a couple of weeks ago and it was not working.  I got in contact with the seller who sent me another watch and guess what this,one does not work either. I cant believe this. I just want a working watch., It stops intermittently after two months of use,  That's long enough so I can't return it.  The warrantee requires mailing it to Japan at my expense., I very much enjoy this watch. It is a heavy, substantial watch that looks terrific. I was surprised to learn it is movement-wound and stops running and has to be reset after less than a day of idleness. Unless you wear it every day, be aware you will need to buy a watch winder, which I did, if you don't want to be resetting it every time you wear it., This has a gray bead blasted type of finish. Functions just fine, but does not match the watch unless it has the same finish. I kept it because I doubt anyone will notice., Received the watch with a dead battery , very nice watch but I think it is unfair to pay $150 for a watch with a dead battery, Classic watch sure to get you some attention with the unique yet classy face. Plus you'll always know what time it is in Paris, London, NYC, etc. Ideal for you jet setting lifestyle, Excellent, The minimal contrast between the black watch face and the blackish watch hands made it impossible for me to tell what the time was without squinting and holding it under a bright light., I ordered a metal band, because I had an unused, brand new, beautiful, working watch, but I hate faux leather & fabric bands. They're sizes are too small & the material wears out quickly.<br /><br />Really like this watch band. It was the right size needed to attach to the watch, so I'm happy that it didn't need to be returned for something bigger/smaller. Love the pattern on the band, & it really does look like it belonged with the watch! I'm not used to stretch watches (the others all have clasps & extra removable links) so it'll take time to get used to the snug fit that stretch bands have. There's no doubt i'll try this again, if I see a watch I like, that needs a new band., This watch is pretty small. Works perfectly and the night light is very good (teal color). Very legible and durable in all conditions., My husband loves this watch!  Found it on another website for $350 and I only paid $200 here on Amazon.  It is absolutely gorgeous!, My daughter's doctor recommended this so we bought it.  it's nice that she listens to the alarms better than her mom but it's not water resistant so she broke her first one.  It's a good watch but I think it's over-priced., the design is very modern and material looks cool. but it was written it was made from steel though I have an irrtation in my skin. so at the end I could not use this watch. I had to give it away, Excelent, it broke the second time i wore it!! cheap material, Completely met my expectations, love them, fit well and thankfully a good friend was able to recommend these., Killer watch!! Easy to read, tough, light, awesome! Ton of compliments on this watch from peers. I would recommend for any situation. Just awesome, Watch came with dead battery, I will try my best to describe this watch in its entirety!<br /><br />Quality: This watch has a nice NATO-style band which has a leather backing around the wrist strap holes. Only issue I have had with the strap is it easily gets caught on long sleeve clothing. So if you live in cold areas (Wisconsin!) or just really like to wear long sleeves, be careful! I had to pick small threads from my jackets and long sleeve tees that were embedded in the edges of the watch. The mineral face is high quality. It helps prevent scratches but is not unscratchable.<br /><br />Time Keeping: Since it is an automatic, it will not have Atomic Clock time keeping skills. You may lose up to a minute a day (Although this is the most you are going to lose). I normally lose 3-4 mins a week. Every watch is going to be different. (Some reviewers say there watch is fast and some say it is slow) I normally adjust it at the end of each week just to keep it &#34;sort of&#34; in sync. If this bothers you to not have an exact time and you are concerned with saying &#34;It's about 1:20ish&#34; instead of saying &#34;1:23 on the DOT&#34; then buy a Quartz watch.<br /><br />Design: This watch has a very unique and interesting design! First off, the design may be confusing right away but it is very easy to read after a few glances at it. (Hours on the inside with minutes on the outside) I actually love the fact of having the day and date on the watch as well. If a friend or teacher needed the date/day I could glance at my watch while everyone else is digging for a phone. Another plus is the clear back. It is interesting to see the watch movements and how the gears work.<br /><br />History: I actually researched the design of this watch (..Yeah, I'm a history nerd) After a few google searches, I found this style of watch was used by German pilots during World War 2. Pretty interesting history behind it. (Google &#34;B-Uhr watches&#34; for more info)<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Since this was my first watch, I wanted to make sure it was the one for me. And sure enough, it was! I am very glad to have purchased this watch and would happily buy another one for a gift. Very interesting and high quality design. I remember I was deciding between this and the Timex Weekender. I decided on the Seiko instead because of the date/day feature and the quietness of the Seiko. If you have ever heard the phrase &#34;Keeps a lickin' keeps on tickin&#34; that is Timex. It has a very loud second hand and that completely deterred me from buying it. I hope this review helped you decide on a watch. If you have questions, feel free to respond to this and I will get back as soon as I can!, Larger than I expected. For the money I can't complain and my 5 year old loves it!, From what I can tell, through visiting a few watch-collectors/fanciers forums, this is not a bad watch for the price. But it’s neither Swiss nor legendary, though it does apparently have some Swiss-made movements. The “Swiss Legend” brand is Chinese-made, and the domestic company is based in Florida.<br /><br />The consensus seems to be that you could get a much better watch for a little more money. I don’t know. Just reporting what appears to be dominant opinions on the forums. Also: If you need service on the watch, that might be an iffy proposition.<br /><br />It is a nice-looking watch and seems solidly built. Aside from issues of quality, the size issue will be a determining factor for many: This watch is HUGE and not for the slender of wrist. Similar to the large Invicto watches.<br /><br />It looks fine (though larger than average) on my husband, who is 6’2”, 230# and “big-boned.”  On my slim friend, however—6’4” and 190#—the watchface is larger than the top of his wrist.  The result: it looks he’s a child wearing his father’s watch.<br /><br />Note:  This is a left-hander’s watch. If you wear the watch on your left wrist, the controls will be on the left side of the watch, I would of given 5 stars... Because the feel of this ESQ is cheap band, watch has no weight. It's a very pretty watch, think $75 would be apprioate for this Movado. I have a white with gold face and it's beautiful, thick strap. This was far from it. But I bought two, one for me and my sister., beautiful watch, Love this watch, very durable and light.  Easy to operate just wish light was a lil better., Ok, The watch look fake, very nice piece of arm jewelry, beautiful color and it goes well with most summer clothing items., Excellent watch for the price. Crystal clear display. Easy to function. Comfortable wristband., Face small, date & week day inaccurate, 👍, Great👌 deal for the price being paid💳. When I bought the item it was 18.88. I thought this was fair for sure. I realized it was VERY fair when I actually received the item💁⬅⌚. I see on here some people saying that some features don't work but I guess it's the luck of the draw because mine all work with this watch. The only thing is that I can't reply to my messages from the watch, bummer oh well. I have the LG📞G3 it's an Excellent pair with this watch 👍.BUY IT NOOOOOW!!❗❕💯✔, mom's present, The mat itself is a really nice quality and easy to wipe and clean up. However, the English is strange on one of the sides. The company should really hire a proofreader if they intend to market and ship to the United States. (Let's play with me, etc.), Excellent design, lightweight . Matches perfectly with my black Citizen watch., Super simple and cheap but this is the watch style that I like. small and efficient, Item is already broken.  Not worth it, plus took a long time to arrive., Wonderfully simple watch. I needed a basic watch that wasn't too expensive, but worked, and that's what I got. I use this watch  pretty much for everything except for suit and tie events. I would get it again., I absolutely love the look of this watch, bought it as a gift.  Unfortunately, I didn't realize how large the face on this watch is, and had to return it.  It is a fantastic value, but make sure to read the product specifications to see if you will fit your wrist., as advertised, This is my 3rd Luminox watch. They are simply the best. I bought the 1st one a little over 12 years ago.  Other than new batteries it is still running., Incredible value for a dive watch.  Have gone to 120' deep with no problems., My favorite watch! I was worried that it was going to be too big since it's a men's watch. I'm a petite female with small wrists.  I had 3 links removed and it fits exactly the way I wanted it to. It has a large face and it's heavy...I absolutely love this watch!  I can wear it dressed up or casual.  I get lots of complements on it.  The price from the seller was great compared to price in department stores.  The shipping was fast and it was packed well.  Very happy with my purchase!!!, Really difficult to install and adjust but it's seems like it will work well. Best to take it to a jeweler for installation unless you have a set of jewelers screwdrivers, and three hands., The watch is a high quality product with a nice finish.  I wish that Orient made it a little smaller maybe 37 or 38 mm rather than 41 mm but I guess the larger watches are now in style and maybe I'll get used to the larger size. To me, this watch seems to have a even higher level of  quality than my older Seiko. Bulova and Gruen automatic watches., Excellent, well made, thick (but not too thick) quality leather watch strap at a great price--unlike some other alledged high end 3rd party merchants (who charge 5-7 times as much for their version, with different end links).  The Hirsch Liberty strap is a timeless classic that worth every penny.  If you have any doubts, just order it and those doubts will be erased upon arrival!, This watch winder works well and is very quiet. I wish the instructions had detail about which watches need what type of winding (bi-directional or not)., I really like Akribos XXIV watches, and I now have  6 in my collection and will order more., This was a birthday gift, and I love it. It's just the right size and a perfect watch for every day and special occasions., My watch isn't working, mom's present, Cheap garbage, it's better to donate thats money to homeless., This a six+ year review. For that many  years I've swam, showered and knocked the humble T43892 around and true to the claim of yesteryears' adverts, this Timex is still ticking. It has been my 'beater' watch and it has more than capably served in that capacity.  This is the damage after all the years of abuse and neglect:: -- The original band gave up the ghost today. Truthfully, I should have retired it a while ago. -- The Timex's acrylic crystal has had a few polishings (courtesy of a dremel, cotton bit and some paste)to buff out accumulated scratches. -- New battery(ies)--I can't recall if I swapped out the battery once, or twice. By the way it's easily exchanged with a 000 Phillips screwdriver.  High value, inexpensive and robust: this watch embodies what a Timex should represent. I love the design: light thin case--it is plastic, easy to read face, integrated retention lug bars and, of course, Indiglo. This design, which Timex has unfortunately discontinued, has proven itself very durable.  The T43892 shows no signs of letting up but if it dies tomorrow I'd still consider it an excellent value., It's a beautiful watch. Would have given 5 stars except it pulls my husband's arm hair!, just cheap all around, The back piece came unglued after wearing it only a few times., Beautiful product.  Well packaged.  It came with a batter installed and an extra battery!  Love it!, This is an excellent watch. It is big and it wears very comfortably. I love the band on it, the holes in the strap are beveled and have a very rugged look to them. The screen is one of the best negative displays I've ever seen on a G-Shock. The back light is awesome and lights up the watch perfectly. I really enjoy the ability of setting a repeat timer too, excellent for the gym. It looks very rugged and I love the black colors on the buttons and the tang on the band. It's the perfect watch for a hard working man...great for law enforcement, military, sportsman, construction. Awesome watch!, Watch was very nice but the pins came out of the band I need to return this item to be fixed under the product warranty, Returned a cheaper product to get this one. High quality and fits my larger watches (e.g. G shock) well., Fantastic., may be  great watch and keep good time but its way to heavy for me.  Took it our of box, held it  and then back in the box and returned it, It is simply awesome.  I will be buying more Invictas in sometime soon and no better place then amazon for this such watch., I ordered this watch for daily use. It arrived as expected. Its a really nice watch with good quality strap., The watch is very nice, fits well, and feels light. The band fits well, but the lock is flimsy. The band broke on me, and it has been very difficult to find a replacement part from invicta. Poor support from them, will not buy invicta watches anymore, It comfortable and affordable. It does not seem that it is made inexpensive., After using it for 2 weeks the experience is not up to the mark. I bought this watch during my trip to USA and when I came back to India, within 1 week of use I saw some part of digital display missing characters. Buttons are also not very smooth and I'm getting a feeling that the buttons might get stuck or come off after couple of months. In general the watch is difficult to use and not very user friendly. I wish there was a repair centre in India where I could get the display fixed.<br /><br />On the good note, I liked 2 things:<br />1. It catches gps quite quickly and data is accurate<br />2. It has a long battery life<br /><br />If soleus people is reading this, can someone pls guide me on where I can get this repaired in India?, Much nicer than expected!  Shipped really quick., Really pretty watch, thin and classy., Bought this for my husband as a Father's Day gift after he kept going on about the one we gave our son for his birthday.  He is extremely happy with it and wears it everyday., Appreciate the quality of work., nice watch for 59.00. shipping was quick also. I have bought six Invicta watches so far and like them all., This is quite honestly my favorite watch of all that I have owned, light, easy to read, and gets complements regularly. Honestly the ticking isn't really noticeable unless you're listening for it specifically. I will definitely be making timex purchases in the future., Watch is really a nice looking watch.  But the watchband fits a child or my wife. Sooo, to make a long story short. ...I can't  find a watchband made for a Man., Excelent, My old sports watch was a Timex Ironman that lasted 20 years until the watchband broke.  I figured I'd replace it with another Timex.  I just needed something basic to take on my runs that was reliable and kept on ticking so to speak.<br /><br />This looked like a comparable replacement and the product description gave me no reason to think it wouldn't be.  I'm not sure if the one I received was just defective or if they are all this bad but it would only allow me to adjust hours and seconds and completely skip over the minutes when setting the time.  The other problem was the alarm was always set to on and I could not turn it off.  I did read the included instructions sheet to see if I missed anything and it's straightforward and everything should have worked.<br /><br />In the end, I decided it wasn't worth more than a 1/2 hour of stress to figure out how to fix it a $13 watch so I sent it back beeping in the box with no way to turn it off.  I ended up getting a Casio W210-1BV Classic Watch with 10-year battery life instead.  No hassles with that one... I just set it up out of the box in a minute or so it worked., Excelente diseño., It stopped working after week,returned it., Excellent, EVEN PRETTIER THAN THE PICTURE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL., I loved this simplicity of design in this watch and received it as a gift.  I wished I had paid attention to the dimensions in the product details, because I could have saved myself from having to return it.  It is a beautiful watch, but the face is slightly larger than my wrist and it didn't fit quite right.  I would repurchase this watch if I could find it with a smaller face., It's adorable and tiny!, I am a Swatch fan from way back in the 1980s.  The Swatch I bought at that time was an Original Gent with a beige band.  It finally died this summer, which is why I found and bought this model.  It's lightweight with a large face, plus it's neutral enough for me to wear with different colors.  I miss my old one, but enjoy wearing this new Swatch very much., The wrist band was too small as well as the dial on watch., An excellent watch with a tenth-rate band., thanks,, made in japan, Not that I expected a top quality clock as it is all plastic and made in China, but I did expect it to be without obvious flaws. It appears that the face behind the plastic front is just printed on paper and the paper does not lay flat. It gives the face a bowed apperance to the numbers. Generally appears to be worth pennies on the dollar. Not what I would expect from Seiko., is not the same in the picture., I have a large wrist and was worried that it would be to small, but<br />even a little loose---looks so nice and dressy, It works!  I have an Ann Cline that I couldn't open for two years and no other service place would do it.  The tool opened it in two tries,  I have a Kenneth Cole that I couldn't open it, and it took a few tries, but it worked!, Do not like strap,  Watch stops running at 4am every morning.  Sorry I bought it., Bought it to use to time medicine doses.  It worked fine until I tried to remove the alarms.  I only added more alarms when I tried to isolate the two alarms that were entered., Thank you!, Nice watch but the color is different from the picture, Thank YOU, bright, shiny, FAKE looking gold. Bleh. I don't like it at all., This has become my husbands my favorite watch!<br /><br />This watch comes with all the trimmings, they took every thought and consideration into every presentation aspect of this watch.<br /><br />When it arrives it will come with a lovely gift bag, warranty information, a leather case for the watch, and a tool so you can remove the links to size to your wrist (pictures attached).<br /><br />The tool to use to size the watch is extremely easy to use. My husband had his watch links removed and sized to his wrist in about 5 minutes (and we didn't have to pay a jeweler!)<br /><br />The watch wears nicely. It is not super light nor super heavy. It is a comfortable weight and you can tell its made of a solid material.<br /><br />The orange metal that is on the typing of the watch looks and stands out nicely on the black background (which reminds me of carbon fiber)<br /><br />Each time keeping aspect of the watch will need to be individually set, this does take a little bit, but it is expected.<br /><br />This is an excellent quality watch and well worth the cost, my husband loves it.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review., Wife likes it but was wishing it had a pedometer, for the money this watch can not be beat. lightweight, simple, functional and easy to read., Lovely watch.  Gold looks good, not cheap.  Very impressed with how it looks and fits., Awesome!, What is it?<br />This is a matte black metal watch band that is sized to fit the Pebble steel edition and the Motorola Moto 360. This band also comes in a Stainless Steel Silver color.<br /><br />What’s Hot<br />Price - This product is relatively inexpensive.<br />Overall the band looks really nice and so far color hasn’t faded on me.<br />For the most part it is easy to remove links (to make band smaller)<br /><br />What’s Not<br />At times it feels like the band is pulling on the hairs on my arm. (And I’m not a hairy person)<br />The color on the underside of the clasp is starting to fade.<br />Pretty hard to install on the Moto 360. (May be because of the of the Moto 360 design )<br />This band actually cracked the back of My Moto 360 so be careful.<br />No watch Spring bars included (Seriously what the hell?)<br /><br />Design: 3.5<br />This Metal band overall looks great. On looks alone I highly recommend it. It also isn’t really that hard to add / remove links to make the band fit you better. I do wish that they made the band a tad more flexible though. I believe that this would have prevented it from crack the back of my Moto 360.<br /><br />Comfort: 4<br />For the most part this band feels nice on the wrist. As I stated earlier, at times it feels like this band is pulling on the hairs on your arm. I also think this band would have benefitted more if it was a tad more flexible.<br /><br />Price: 5<br />If one thing is right about this product it would be the price. You can’t go wrong at a $12.99 sticker tag.<br /><br />Average: 2.9<br />Via Amazon<br /><br />Thoughts<br />I liked this watch band but I did get a tad salty when my Moto 360’s back cracked because of it. So in the end i find it hard to recommend it to my friends .<br /><br />Score<br />15.4 / 20<br />77, Very nice watch; took a couple of days to get use to the weight, but after a few weeks you forget your even wearing it.  Would recommend to others, This case arrived in a timely manner and packaged well.  It is exactly as adveftised. It hold 4 watches snugly with enough extra romm for a couple of my everyday watchrs., I had to return one already because the back fell out and the new one is loose and jingles too. but its a very cute watch., Great watch.  I've had this one for a few years now.  It's as tough nails and keeps accurate time.  I don't need a watch with a chronograph, calendar or any other function aside from telling me what time it is and this one does the job.<br /><br />You can soak the band in some Biz or Oxiclean and it will look as new as the day you first put the watch on.  The numbers really glow well in the dark (not like the dim &#34;indiglo&#34; watches) and are large enough to see at first glance.<br /><br />A fine watch, arrived on time, new condition as described, working well, This Watch Is Definitely A Must Have.  I have received numerous complements as well as people wanting to buy it from me., Very nice watch, fits comfortably. I just wish it was a little larger, personal preference., I had to find a teenager to set the time and date. But there's teenagers everywhere so no problem. but i do like it and am happy with the product, Had to give it 1 star, it couldn't properly keep time as the second hand would continually stop and start. Tried resetting it multiple times and it just wouldn't work. This will be the first item I've returned through Amazon.com... I'm sure the other watches work fine, I just got the bad one!! Thanks to Amazon for making it an easy return, gift for a 9 year old girl, she likes very much., This strap looks great on a silver or gold watch case.  This watch drys fast and it doesn't slide around on the wrist.  But the leather material on top can show creases when the strap is bent backwards., bought as a gift. was very well received. would buy from again, EXCELLENT, beautiful band<br />delivery was a little slow - I am an Amazon Prime member so the bar for delivery times has become irrationally high.<br />Was bought as a replacement for my 25 yr old Mickey Mouse watch so I can give it to my daughter.  My wife thought it wouldn't match but I (and my daughter) think it looks great.<br /><br />A bonus is that there is tiny lever in the band that you slide across to slip it into the watch - difficult to describe but this was unexpected and made installing very simple., Excellent replacement band for my St. Moritz Pathfinder., Decent cheap watches, I purchased same watch from Sam's, without the Japan movement.  Loses approx. a minute a week and has since new.  Spend a little more and get the Japan movement (keeps much better time from online reviews and my own experience with Seiko)., I was not prepared to like this watch as much as I do. I generally don't love digital watches, preferring to actually tell time. But this face, while busy, is very clear. It is easy to see the time (including seconds), as well as the day and date. If you travel or work in multiple time zones, you can save three. The watch also has stopwatch and timer functions, and is water resistant to 330 feet.<br /><br />I was concerned that I would sweat under the plastic strap, but it is light enough and can sit loosely enough that I have no problem with it. The color is lovely, not a bright lime green, but more like a light &#34;Tiffany box&#34; turquoise. It actually matches my water bottle.<br /><br />And finally, I don't love bulky watches, and this watch is not bulky. It is light and easy to maneuver.<br /><br />For the price point (under $30 retail, less than $25 on Amazon) this is a stellar watch from Armitron., Simply works as desired. Perfect., This watch is dope ! It's stylish and unique and of course goes with anything outfit and it's a reasonable price. This watch it's a must buy, ladies and gentleman. Now tell your family and friends !!!, This watch is really good quality.  My wife loves it and wears it for work and everything else too.  The band and time piece are well made and stand up to wear and tear., A little cheap. But you knew that already., I purchased this item thinking that I might use it on occasion.<br />I have not gone back to the original SS band since, several months.<br />Excellent Price-Value, and very comfortable., The watch broke a week ago and I can't get a hold of anyone to honor the warranty. If I can get it repaired or replaced I will change this review, Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He loves it.  Just the right size with features on the face and dial he likes.  Too early to know how it performs but so far we are very pleased., Beautiful watch, but I will have to remove extra links for the watch to fit on my wrist., Use my watch daily. I get a lot of compliments on it., I love skagen watches, every one I've owned, but this is my all time favorite. I've had it for almost a year, wearing it 4-5 days a week all day and it still looks and runs perfect. It's simple, elegant, sophisticated and comfortable. It looks great with jeans and a t shirt or an evening gown, plus it's just the right size. If you're considering buying it for yourself or you're looking for the perfect gift for your wife or girlfriend, buy this one., Perfect!!!!, I just received it ,fine, just identify the quality., The crystal goes black when I'm wearing my polaroid sunglasses.  Other than that, this is a good watch and I like it. My previous Casio was quite similar but without the polaroid issue. But after many years, the crystal was scratched and worn out., cheap, After 5 months of very light use (no underwater or heavy work/sports activity) the display went blank. Later the same day, the arm holding the band to the body fractured and fell apart.  Sure, it was cheap, but I wish I had applied the money to a better watch., My daughter's 5th Shark watch - she loves these thing - many styles/colors to choose from., Very beautiful, look better than picture, I love it so much. Recommend!, Awesome looking watch!, Really happy with this watch. Perhaps the best ABC watch I've owned (and there have been many).<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fast, responsive screen and hands.<br />Countdown timer can count down from 99 days to 0. Not sure why I need 99 days, but the trend in many digital watches now is to only count down from 60 minutes. I like being able to countdown multiple hours - especially useful for things like flying.<br />Solar powered - I love that I never need to change a battery in my Tissot again. A+ on this feature..<br />Titanium case and sapphire glass.<br /><br />Cons (and these are pretty minor):<br />Did not come with a manual, however one is available online on the Tissot web site.<br />Unable to change barometric reading to inches of mercury (commonly used in the US). Readings are only available in hectopascals. (Hectopascals are used everywhere else except the US). Not a big deal, but you may have to do some conversion if calibrating against some weather reports.<br />Reverse LCD screen: while it looks goods on the watch, is a little hard to read in some lighting conditions.<br />Backlight could be better. The LCD lights up, but not the rest of the face.<br />Rubber strap has to be cut to fit. This means you have to be very careful when measuring the fit the first time. Measure twice, cut once - you'll have to buy a new strap if you mess this step up.<br />No temperature reading. Not a huge deal as they tend not be highly accurate on a watch, but would have liked to have seen it to round out the Meteo functionality.<br />Hands should be a little longer.<br />Would like to see a few additional features such as sunset, sunrise.<br /><br />But, overall, very pleased with this version, and would highly recommend this watch., Excellent leather band platform for my Military MP Watch.........Very well made with sturdy metal buckle., I've had several other g-shock watches during my time in the Marines and they always worked well for me. This is the first watch I've purchased since I retired and I like the look of it. I like the larger display. With this watch at my age I can tell the time without having to put on my reading glasses. One of the main reasons I purchased this watch was for the compass but it's a little difficult for me at my age to read and still haven't really figured out how to use it but that might just take some working with it. It does have thermometer but that wasn't a big selling point. I also like the additional digital time for when traveling.  Overall I'd recommend it., It's unique in design. I'm very impressed with their packaging., We love our clock. It is beautiful and the music is excellent quality., Classic, standard, g-shock quality, at what I believe to be one of the lowest (if not the lowest) priced g-shock. Not flashy, but at the same time it looks good and cool. You can literally wear it doing anything, although you might want to take it off occasionally to clean it a bit, because it will gather up your sweat and dead skin cells and whatever else you come in contact with. Its a great watch, easy to use, great functions (stop watch, alarm, timer), and tells everything that you basically need to know (time am/pm and military, date, day of the week). Super sturdy and its been an essential for me, I wear it everyday for the most part. In the ocean, in the shower, in the hospital, playing basketball, you don't really need to worry about taking it off because it won't break. In fact you should take it off during basketball because you might hurt someone if you hit them in the face with the watch. It's pretty indestructible, just youtube the tests they put these watches through. It's reliability is part of what makes this watch so appealing. Its durability in combination with its classic design and many functions, its probably the best value watch to go for at its price., Broke after 18 months. Digital still works but analog needles no longer move. Changed the battery but did not help. When still working, it was an OK watch only. The hands often obscured the digital segments making them difficult to use, and the logic of the buttons still escapes me., This is a very nice watch. The quality is impressive for their price. I got it for my sister for her work and she loves it! Just the right amount of sparkle yet low key and not too flashy. Even has a plastic hold on knob to prevent it from running before it is purchased so you know you get the full life of the battery the minute you take the plastic safety off. I really like these watches. There are so many to choose from!, Definitely a showstopper - I get complimented on this piece constantly. Plus I get to have the time of my love overseas until we are together again. :) Everything worked great. The only thing that would be NICE, is a button for glowing hands or something like that. But considering the price, and the fact that most of us look to our phones for the time nowadays...I am NOT complaining. :), Perfect!  Exactly what an expensive watch deserves, particularly a dive watch (what they're intended for) that might end up on the bottom of the ocean if a spring bar fails.  Not all bands leave enough space for these chunky bars, but I would change the band before I'd give up these!, Love the look of watch. People think I spent more than I actually did., Very high-quality bees. Very satisfied, The watch is very nice, as advertised. On my watch band there is a barely visible zig zag where the leather is pieced together. Also the back of one of the loops has a stitch on it that itched my wrist. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase., I bought this watch to use while coaching. It's a very good looking watch and I end up using it casually as well. Really solid watch., Just what my husband wanted . it meets all his expectations, I only give it a four due to the fact there is NO luminescence at all. I am buying the chrono version for the light so at least I can wear it at night. I( bought it because it looks almost identical to a Bell & Ross 01-92 which is a $3000.00 watch. If this one had good bright lume, I'd buy ten of them. I do wish they had them in different colour faces, I'd buy on e in each colour for sure. Good watch for the money for sure., The one I received is totally not working. It never move a second. I am so surprised. Thanks Amazon, I can return it. I have to say, the watch looks nice. But it is not reliable. Tissot scared me., Overall,  it's a nice watch but the battery was dead when i received it.  I will just have to replace the battery., The band turned out to be the right style but the wrong size.  It looked to be of great quality, however, and the customer service for the return  (which was free) was excellent. It was worth taking the chance., Came in as described. The watch was a bit too big for my wrist and a lot smaller than I anticipated but it was nice after having it resized.  Quick shipment!, Ah gift well appreciated, very satisfied with the quality of the watch., Amazing and very large watch. So good looking and very strong construction. A great watch for a big and tall man.<br />Update nov. 8: the watch stared to fade off the silver color and broke the band.<br />I thing this Is not an every day use watch., PROS:<br />- Handsome contemporary watch for all occasions, rugged and accurate.<br />- Sharp looking watch without a stem because it's a digital watch with an analog face.<br />- Sleek watch band that should last forever.<br />CONS:<br />- The LED-based night-light is only good for reading the time, not the date.<br />- The watch body is thicker than most watches., I bought it for my sister and sent it to Nepal. She loved it. But she said it stopped working after 2 months., I love this black with grey Nato strap.<br /> Thanks Long Island watch for your fast service., Ok money for cheap watch a bit too heavy doesn't look nearly as gaudy in a picture as it is in real life makes a good boat watch, This was to replace a well-used leather strap on my beloved Timex triathlon watch.  I noticed at first that it wasn't quite as nice as the previous strap---leather not as supple, and not shaped as well at the pin.  This however, was not the biggest problem.  Shortly after I put it on the watch, it fell off at the pin.  I thought I had not quite got it in the hole, and redid it.  Tragically, the next day, during a bus trip, it fell off again, and I lost the strap AND my favorite watch.  The problem is that the pin is cheaper and less sturdy than it should be--perhaps shorter, too. What a stupid way to cut corners, Timex!, Two years after wearing this watch at least twice a month, its still as beautiful as always., Great clock for our home office. Can't go wrong with Seiko. Music is beautiful too. Excellency buy as well., Broke after 3 months. :(, Hung this in my front patio.  Nice large numbers, so when I'm backing out of my garage, I can easily see what time it is.  The whole neighborhood can see what time it is when they drive by!  Clock face is protected from elements., Love the look but not worth the effort.  Watch did not work when I received. Spent $50 on new battery.  Worked for 1 month., I'm envious of all those people who got this watch and loved it.  I had to wait an extra couple of weeks to get it, and when I did, it did not meet my expectations, not even the slightest.  I had a nearly impossible time pairing the HR belt to my watch and my Samsung 5 to the watch.  The program lagged so much and froze my android several tomes.  I even tried a different android as well as my ipad.  It was such a hassle and still didn't work to display HR data (or any data) that I didn't even try to get the text notification feature working, which I was so looking forward to. Completely useless to me without reliable and easy HR monitoring just for the initial test (I retried literally 52 times, and it might have paired twice, but no continuous data, so I don't think the connection kept).  And I was looking forward to using the HR monitoring under water.  Basically, either I got a real lemon or the technology isn't so smooth and reliable yet/my expectations were too high.  I can't believe all of these people who just love this watch., It's an okay watch but feels kind of cheap, This watch is very sporty and chic. Will look beautiful as a cranberry accessory for a Fall outfit., I dislike most G shock watches. I think they do get attention, but the bulkiness and the colors (might as well be a rubber band bracelet) is pointless. Most are trend watches.<br /><br />Now i have more then a few watches. But only one G shock 100 B ACR, which is my best watch regardless of the price. I bought 5 g shocks afterwards to try and get that same feeling, but returned every single one.<br /><br />i have found one that gives me the same feeling as my first G shock. Every function is useful, and every button serves a simple purpose. From a perspective of someone who is shallow in their choosing, (mostly citizen, bulova, and victorinox watches) I found a favorite. This watch is almost intimidating because aesthetically everything is in the right spot color scheme is just right, when you see it, but once it goes on your wrist... game over. also people don't mention this enought, the night light on it is awesome, only the minute dots, and hour numbers light up bright blue (not like a light at the bottom illuminating the face). Also has a feature where every time you look at the watch at night only, it will light up for you. Words can't do justice to the wow factor. Next time you take it off there will be a tan line on your wrist, from wearing it too long. If you scroll through countless selections of watches, trying to make up your mind and you're unsure, get this one. Absolute perfection.<br /><br />I'm not a collector or a hoarder of watches, but this is a g shock you can take to a board meeting or keep it on and get compliments on the ski slopes. i don't think we get to appreciate those wow's enough, but if you get a chance to open the box for this watch and put it on... it will change your life in a small way. How much more can you ask for from a small purchase!, I love my mickey mouse watch..it is smaller than i wanted ,but thats ok., Looks exactly as shown. Only issue for me was that it was a bit larger face than I expected otherwise a nice look., This is a nice looking watch.  The blue is not quite as bright as the photo but is still lovely.  I had to get a jeweler to remove two links so it would fit snugly even though I have a larger than usual wrist, and is it very comfortable to wear.  My only criticism is that the case is rather thicker than I would like at around 1 cm but I can live with it.  It keeps good time and is OK to wear in the shower and swimming in the ocean or pool with no problems.  I like that it has a second hand and roman numerals rather than regular numbers.  I purposely did not want a date window since I think it makes the watch face looker cleaner and less cluttered.  It does not have luminous numerals and that is just fine for my taste.  All in all I am pleased with my purchase., The watch looks great and hopefully will function well too. Since it's a quartz there is no question of accuracy. The metallic bracelet is very smooth and weighty, and the dial is a little too flat and slim. I hope the rose gold colour lasts long. Perfume and other alcoholic solvents or solutions should be avoided. The crown, when pulled to adjust the date seems to have a very low margin between the date and time adjustment. Had to carefully pull it to adjust the date. Otherwise the watch is good for the price it's available, if one buys it from the authorized retailers, it's not worth what they are charging., Gorgeous watch for happy with the purchase, Looks like good. But, It looks very big dial size and day display is little mistake. I don't like it., Good watch, very simple and elegant. The face of the watch scratches a little easy, though. Have to be careful., I am loving my new watch and bracelet set! I wear them everyday to the office. It gives me a sophisticated look!, Turned wrist green, Will not fit my phone, gave it to a friend, Money's worth is what you get, Why the is it so hard to put time on this can someone help me out before I send it back, I bought this for my husband, who has a lot of watches, he really liked this for the color of the dial. It is a really pretty color, blue gray., The display is nice and the light is bright enough, but this is the worst alarm ever. It's quiet and only chimes for one minute., Arrived broken and had to return it., very cool design and very light to male exercise, Very nice watch, it was a little difficult for me to figure out the settings. I like that it shows the date and has a nice time display so that I can time patient exercises. the last clear strapped watch I wore got very stained after wearing it for a few months. That has not happened with this watch and I've worn it daily for months., Beautiful looking watch, quite unique. Comfortable fit also. At first glance i thought the watch was not working because it does not have a second hand. I was wrong it is working perfectly.., Beautiful watch - exactly as advertised and at a fantastic price, Excelente producto, Classic, simple, refined, and clean looking watch at an outstanding price. Delivered on time, with proper documentation and packaging from the producer., Love it  but it looks kinda dark like it's already getting black, I like the Skagen watches, but I really love this one.  It is elegant and can be worn to the office or out., It is a sleeper, the best mechanic movement from Seiko in an affordable watch.  It is the same 6R15 caliber as in the famous Sumo diving watch, which I also have and accuracy is extremely good for a mechanical watch.  Mine runs about 15 seconds slow in 21 days. without wearing it in a winder.  It evens up a little better when the watch is worn.  The 6R15 caliber far surpasses in accuracy the new 4R36.  This latter caliber is no better that its predecessor the 7S26 caliber except the two features, which it has in common with the 6R15, that it can be hand wound and it is hackable.  The watch is an excellent value, especially since it also has a sapphire window and it is very high quality.  Watches three times the price of this watch have no better features and accuracy., Beautiful watch that I haven't taken off since I have gotten it. I will buy another orient in the future, Had this watch for a while now.. As a bartender I've put it to the test many times and it's held up very well. I've seen some bad reviews on the band but I think it's great. Has a very sleak look and doesn't feel too heavy on the wrist. Definitely recommend this one., Great pocket watch, The watch has kept perfect time since I received it.  The only problem is the embossing. The helmet should be a Vietnam era helmet rather than the newer helmet introduced 30 years after Vietnam that is used today.  The design approval team did not pay attention to such an obvious detail., Stopped working but not worth shipping back, Winder worked marginally well for a bit over a year before it failed. At best, the motion is jerky, at worst, it doesn't work at all. You get what you pay for, Great solid feel.  Definitely would recommend.  I used this beautiful engineer bracelet on my SKX009K2 which I put in place of the stock jubilee bracelet that comes with the SKX009K2.  Best choice ever.  This bracelet and watch together is a completely different presentation and feel.  If you prefer the jubilee I would recommend the aftermarket jubilee bracelet as the stock bracelet is too light and the appearance shows it., The watch didn't work from the moment I received it., its a Timex, it is excellent  I like it, I bought it last Apr 2015. So it has been only 4 month but the side of coting is peeling off already.  Can not wear it anymore., excellent watch looks very cool on hand looking, I set the time to the same time as my phone, exactly, down to the second. 24 hours later I checked both times, my watch was 2 minutes ahead of my phone. Good build and feels nice hut it's just so inaccurate. Also going swimming with this watch messes everything up because of the touchscreen.<br /><br />Update:<br />About 3 months after buying it the rubber band just snapped off., large watch, very comfortable.  Looked at it in silver--too shiny--black is just right., Awesome! Affordable, works great.  Easy setup right out of the box.  Very comfortable. Light is awesome, extremely easy to read at night.  Also has a variety of light options / colors...really cool!, Not an original timex.  This Chinese knock off.  Be careful., He likes it a lot. Was replacement for older similar watch.<br />Light on the wrist, had ordered a metal one that was way too heavy<br />for him. Sent back, quick refund, no hassle.<br />Thank you Amazon., I get so many compliments on this watch. I love it, but the band is still very stiff after a few weeks of wearing. It also is definitely losing time, but it's a cheap watch, so it was worth it still., Not bad. Said it was brown but the band that came on mine was black. Still not a bad product for the price. Only wish it would say if the watch is water proof or not. But it's cheap enough that I am sure I will get plenty of use out of it before I find out., Not so good.., Got this for my sister for graduation, ended up just being a medallion with some Gallifreyan printed on it. She loved it luckily enough, but very cheap., I like the watch. Usually, I wear more expensive watches but thought I'd add this one to my collection. Very heavy indicating, at least to me, that it was built with quality parts. I bought two I plan to give one yo my brother for Christmas. One caveat. Removing bracelet links to reduce the wrist size proved challenging for  me. Although I have done this several times on many different watches, this time I had more difficulty for some reason. Maybe it's me 😁, This watch was way too big for my hubby's frame.  I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the watch itself., I like this, but i want that it came fast to my house please....., Didn't keep up with the time although it is considered scientific. This was set up according to the instruction sheet that was read before adjusting the time sequence so Zi think it may have been a lemon..... I hope the rest weren't like this one., Excellent watch, extremely accurate out of the box.  Easy to keep it going, built up full reserve in two days of wearing the watch.  It became my favorite watch in no time and I am a watch collector with well over two dozen good watches.  The blue dial is very nice and the luminescence lasts through the night if the watch is put under light for 8-10 seconds before turning in.  The window is made of sapphire which is the best material and increases the value of the watch also.  The watch can be obtained for a very good price from many vendors., Bought this for my husband for AIT. He loves it, however some of the settings that come from factory were a little annoying to him, he had to change them. Otherwise, it is perfect., Makes a strong statement.  Extremely handsome watch.  Sexy and great looking, the black stainless speaks power.  Not a light weight watch, heavy feel and weight, your guy will feel bold wearing this and love you for it.  Does not come in that icky orange box shown on description page, I am including the actual attractive box it will arrive in. Much better.  Also, for all you snorkel/scuba folks like us, I have added the information on this watch and what it can handle.  It is ranked IV.  This watch is a winner., Its a little big and thick, but a very nice watch for $35.00.  Replaces my Tag Heuer just fine at less than 1/10th the cost of having the Tag's battery replaced, with a cleaning., I got this for my younger brother, he loves it. He wears it every day and uses the compass functions for Scout stuff. It is a little difficult to figure out (you may need to reference the directions) but overall it works as advertised., This watch is awesome I'm going to buy one in every color, I bought this just for fun and it's became my favorite watch. yeah the shipping took awhile but everyone that I've shown the watch to thinks it's really cool and expense. it was worth the wait, if I need to I would buy one again., watchband is very very inadequate, it's more like a woman's watch., Don't waste your money. I charged the watch, as per the instructions, and it would never work. Returned it the next day., Amazing product I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bulova, Just as the previous reviewer mentioned, my watch also arrived with a dead battery. It's pretty frustrating to have to purchase a new watch battery, especially considering the price of this watch. Pretty disappointing., Good,quality band  but should have been the double pin band, My husband loves it! It's the right size for a 5,5&#34; frame.  Not too big, not too small. It  looks like the Rolex submariner and yet it carries it's own feature as an Invicta., It is very beautiful. Been getting lots of compliments., I've decided to return this watch. It lost more than 90 seconds of time in the first two days and according to it's specifications it shouldn't lose any more than a few seconds per week. In addition to the fact the one I purchased was defective, the watch has a few design flaws. The watch hands that you use to tell time are VERY difficult to read in most normal lighting situations and at most normal angles. You can easily see the chronograph seconds timer hand but it frequently takes seconds to even locate the minutes hand when reading the time. The watch is visually appealing and with a couple of minor changes to the contrast of the hands to make them easier to read this could be a great watch. The flyback chronograph feature and second time zone feature both work well. Unfortunately, overall, this watch does not meet my needs., cheap and only worked for 3 days, So enjoy my Timex watch!, They don't look cheap and are do pretty., Perfect for everyday use, everyone should have one!!!!, First, let's be clear: this is huge! Second, the crown has been on the opposite side on previous watches, so that's a change, though I think it was necessary due to size. Third, the large second hand is devoted to the chronograph so in normal operation, it's not going around, which is a bit odd.<br /><br />All that said, this watch is great. It is eye-catching and classic. It looks modern and hip. I feared the wristband would look boring, but it's far nicer than pictured. It functions as expected, and it isn't showing any wear yet., Smaller than it looked, This was a gift for my daughter, she absolutely loves it! It is so well done, and does everything well., Excelente, Excelent, This is a great watch, but it is HUGE! I like larger watches, but this one made me feel like I was wearing a satellite dish on my wrist. Because of the size, I had to return it., It's a basic watch for my simple needs. I wear it on casual days and it looks good., What a fun, youthful design for a watch to wear with any shade of teal or turquoise., The watch looks good especially for the price. But the worst thing about the watch is that there is not pins to adjust the watch. You can only take out links. The watch is too loose for me but if I take out another link it becomes too tight. Other watches, you can make small changes by moving small notches, but not this watch. The other negative thing is how difficult it is to read the face of the watch. There are four Roman numerals and lines for the other numbers. It takes a second to figure out the time, but that's just me. There are also two external buttons, but they don't do anything--they're just for show., Where gifts that everyone where happy with and fair priced. Decent quality. Long chain., Excellent product. Durable and accurate., Excellent! Totally silent. Product exactly as advertised. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Highly recommend., Cheaply made, you get what you pay for., Beautiful but the strap little too long, I wore twice and while wearing it the second time the glass face fell off. Horrible product won't recommend to anyone., The front glass fell out of my watch within the first week I had it. But it keeps on ticking holding the correct time still., Excellent watch.  Smaller than other G-Shocks and suits my wrist., I just received the watch and so far this review is on looks only. But what an AWESOME looking watch, especially for the price! I would have paid way more for the same watch but it looks even better than the pictures! The blue shows up so well and you can watch all the cranks, it is awesome!  update: This watch still works amazingly! One of my favorites, I get compliments a lot!, I had owned this watch previously, but lost it. I liked the look of it so much that I decided to repurchase it, but this time online. It looks exactly as I expected and works fine. I like that it comes with three removable links that I can remove myself to fit my wrist. My only problem with it is that one of the pins that holds two links together was not completely inserted. I need to take it to a watch repair shop to have this fixed. I wish I could have worn it right out of the box, but no such luck., stopped working after 2 days, This is a very attractive **HUGE** watch. It is BIG and round and THICK and HEAVY. Much too big for my wrist. But it is pretty. I sent it back., was not the quality I expected. The packaging was also poor quality., This watch looks even better in person then online. I've had a lot of people stopping to ask what the watch is. Very very happy with this purchase., I really like my new watch; color, size, band texture, weight and style. I looks &#34;Great in my watch case collection., Beautiful watch!!  I look forward to never needing to replace batteries. I got the wrong instruction book- one for model V175 - but I didn't have trouble setting it and getting it going., I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He has a Michael Kors collection of watches.  The band on this one was the perfect size.  He did not need to have any links removed.  P.S. He loved it.  He wanted this one for a while but it sold out fast on the Michael Kors Website.  Plus it was cheaper at Amazon.  Win Win!!, I have a water-proof girly watch :) . Now I know the date and time at work! I hope this watch lasts for many years!!, This was easy to install. The directions were very clear and I followed them to a T. No bubbles with a clean fit, if I did not know there was a screen protector it would not at all be obvious. I wish my smartphone protector (different brand) was this easy., Best watch I've ever bought., My 15 year old son Love It, now I can rest from my son, he always looking to use all my watch collection, recommended..!, My mom loves the set, being able to change the bands to match her outfits., beautiful, Looks better in the pictures, Beautiful watch, but anyone who delivers a watch at this price, with a dead battery, deserves a 0 star... Sadly, I cannot go lower than 1 star.<br /><br />If you order this watch, be prepared to spend a little more for a new battery., Stopped working almost immediately; seller gave me the option of a new one or my money back. I chose money back., love the quality of this leather straps... the cool feature is that you never have to remove the pins at the lugs... all you have to do is insert the open end in the lug and you got a nice, secure fit in the lug... very cool and innovative design... it also comes with its own lug pin, For the price this is awesome, I am happy with my purchase. I think it feels a little cheap and its very light for being a metal band, I just expected it to be heavier but it fits good, feels secure I'm not worried about it becoming unhinged or the clasp not holding and my watch falling off. I work in a auto shop which is why I wanted a metal band and this makes my watch look just as good as with the original asus zenwatch leather strap. I have gotten so many compliments on it, everyone thinks it's the apple watch. I'm not an apple fan but I will give them credit for making nice products, so I haven't decided to take it as a good thing or not. My only gripe is that I would like for the locking mechanism on the clasp to lock from both sides instead of just one, I think that would just make it even harder to come undone over time. Like I said for the price this is a good buy, looks nice, feels nice, I'm happy., This is a fun little watch. I'm not in love with it, but I'll get to that. It's an interesting piece because it's different. It's not the best way to tell time because it has no increments between hours. The main concern I have is that the face looks to plasticy -- meaning, they should change the description of the face to more accurately reflect what the face is made out of. As I said though, I would buy it again because it's definitely unique, which is what I was looking for., It arrived one day early in perfect condition. It seems to be exactly as described. The dial backlight feature is very effective and useful in low light or no light conditions., It's amazing! I couldn't be happier with it., Pleased with my purchase... never knew there were so few mechanical watches made these days. What good is a cheap digital watch (or an expensive one) if we ever have an EMP attack or solar storm that affects the grid and electronics? Planning to buy another for my teenage boy in case we need to coordinate movements... he likes how it looks too. The only downside I can see some thinking it has is that you do need to wind it every 36 hours or so... but that is the point of no batteries, eh?, Awesome!, Still wearing this watch on the daily a year later., This watch is perfect if you want to actually be able to tell time and not much else...other than have a cool watch:) It's unisex but has plenty of adjustments for my thin wrist, so easily fits. I got this because I was sick of looking at my phone for the time and I do NOT want a watch that behaves like a phone., Very handsome & unique wristwatch, very high quality, very comfortable to wear., Just did not like it on, Great for 5 months then water creeps in and it's done. Plus when we bought it, it came with a 2 year warranty ... amazingly, it too seems to have gone away. Amazon = Alibaba = trash products. Sorry, but often true., Gorgeous watch but if you have a thin wrist it will be very loose., Everybody gave me a compliment for this watch !!, I love this product and yes I will be order it again it another color blue....thank you!!!!, can't beat it for the price., Band broke in half out of nowhere at dinner the first night I wore it.  Love the brand but disappointed in this particular lemon.  Hope to resolve the issue with the seller., I would add another star to this watch!!! It's extremely eye catcher, and really looks BIG!!! Amazon service is outstanding, the shiping on time, and the box very clean. I'm planing to get some of them for gifts. Congratulations!!!, Looks good in picture but it's huge... And my wrist are tiny.... But still a really nice watch..., You can't beat the price. Especially when it comes with 3 bands. The watch face is VERY small. Like child's size watch small. I have small wrists and it is still tiny. Craftsmanship is clearly lacking already. It has not run for 24 hours consecutively since I bought it. The watch stops daily. Buy this for the bands or if you don't care about checking the time, The watch fits perfectly on my wrist and I have already received so many compliments on how it looks., Beautiful watch. The face is the perfect size for my smaller wrists.  Only downside is that it is a little loud, although not anywhere as loud as my Timex Weekender., everything Excellent, Doesn't matter how pretty it is if it doesn't even last a year.  Eventually wouldn't auto wind or hold a manual wind.  At that price, I expected better quality., the face is a bit small to actually read well but love the look, wonderful watch., Very easy to read.  Stay charged with no effort.  Thickness of the watch is such that it will not catch on clothing easily.  Have had the watch less than a month, and so far I love it., Like that I don't have to wind or put a battery in it, This is a great watch. The white leather band and the wooden face really pop. Also since they're neutral colors the watch should work with a wide range of outfits. It just feels very modern/hip/cool. The watch itself is very light. Very comfortable when you're wearing it. I could see it working for men and women.<br /><br />The watch face is a good size and it's clean. Not too big and not too tiny. Very minimalist with only the hour/minute/second hands and the Woodies logo visible. I will say that the Woodies logo appears slightly off center on my watch. However, I think that's the aesthetic the company was going for. I dig the font. I haven't taken the watch near water but I'm sure it can handle a few splashes here and there. I would be careful to dry the wood off asap though.<br /><br />The watch is very quiet. It doesn't make that annoying ticking sound you get from Timex watches. I haven't had to change the battery yet but it looks simple enough to change. There are four tiny screws on the back of the watch.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is definitely a great watch to add to your collection if you're looking for something that is fashionable and functional.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., Simple, light, easy to use. I recommend it for any sport especially outdoor., Workmanship was not exactly what I expected..., Had for a year now still works just fine!, Horrible experience. Watch is reasonable, but the unnecessarily over-engineered clasp mechanism broke within a week of normal day-today wear. I will be returning this item. Stay away!, Bought this for my fiancée and she loves it. The exact one she wanted too. Rose good looks nice and according to her very stylish!, The watch looks like a million bucks.  My husband has had numerous compliments from other men on the watch's looks.  So far, the watch has functioned well.  We are happy with this purchase., Good design; better for heavy outdoor work, such as logging, than a wrist watch.  Clips easily to a belt loop from which position it is easy to read.  The light is easy to operate and very handy., This is awesome gift i bought it for myself and its been more than 4 years. love this piece., My 1st. Purchase with Amazon . Really satisfied with the product., Awesome watch for the price,,,,,,,,very nice looking thank you very much, Sleek and stylish. My friends introduced me to the gold looking watches for that classy feel. This one is just about right at 43mm. I normally wear a 45mm watch that I feel is perfect but the 43mm gives it a subtle sleek look and I'm not hating. Plus, if you're tanned it looks better!, it works great  but i am having a hard time adjusting it to my wrist size because i am a little smaller than the Mens standard. size, My wife bought this for me for my birthday, and I am in love.  Something about this watch just feels... right.  I have been wearing it for a little over a week now all day every day.  It is not too heavy, I forget it is on now.  I have a nickel allergy, and have had 0 issues with the watch.  It keeps time very well.  I had to set it twice, once when I first got it and once the next day, and it has not been off at all since.  I can tell time to within 2 or 3 minutes if I read it standing still, and within 5 minutes when I am walking/driving.<br /><br />I found the nearest sasquatch and had them try it on to take some pictures.  It really does look amazing in person.<br /><br />Edit:  I have wanted to love this watch, but the movement stopped working correctly after about 4 months, and despite battery replacement, stopped completely.  I sent it in for Asurion warranty service 3 times, but it never returned to full functionality and stopped again after each service.  I so wish I could love this watch because I really did enjoy using it, but the movement has not been reliable and the warranty service has been even worse.  Therefore I cannot recommend it., Fine watch, Nice watch, a bit smaller than I thought but it doesn the job., It loses about a minute per week. I think that very good for an automatic watch. I also like the durable band it's attached to., It LOOKS identically to the one I have; however it does not have the &#34;indiglo&#34; feature like my other one.  It was hard to disguinish that from the photo.  I would not buy another one...., Excellent seller recommend, I paid $55 for this watch, they have the list price at $695, which is baloney (do not pay that much, obviously).  But for $55, I am happy with it.  But best to think of it as simply a cheap watch.  For example, none of the chronograph dials don't work at all on mine.  Perhaps mine is just a defect, but that is a pretty big defect.  If I bought it at a store I would take it back, but in this case (a negative of Amazon), it is too much trouble and not worth it.  So, I accept that the dials are just fake to make it look fancier.<br />It is quite heavy, and very thick - so, it might be a bit too big for my wrist (certainly it would never slide under the cuff of a long-sleave dress shirt), but that's ok.  I still like it, and if you prefer heavy, thick watches then you will really like it.  It is exactly as the pitcures and the little video show it.  And one thing that I also like which is hard to see from the pictures is that the band is thick and feels very durable, but is still very flexible and comfortable.<br />For $55, my rating is 4 stars as a cheap watch.  For $695 I would be screaming that I got totally ripped off., thanks, This is a realy cute watch.  Very please with the leather, color and size of the face of the watch.  I recommend it., Case & watch face &#34;Sparkles,&#34; drawing a little attention!<br />Highly accurate, solid, easy open watchband, beautifully designed.<br />Whether I'm dressed up, or usual day Casual, this watch makes the look Perfect. It feels solid,what else can I say, but I love it !!, Love this simple little watch. I'm still trying to read the mini encyclopedia that came with it however to try and use all the functions.  I wear this watch everyday with every sport, tennis, running, at the gym. Its not heavy.  I'm not really into counting calories or steps etc. I know I do a lot so I don't need to try and measure my daily functions. No heart rate, no GPS, no step counter, but it has a stop watch, split for laps, date, you can save a few speed run times. I really like it., Wish I could say something nice, the watch is light, stylish, but now the second one that arrived (as a replacement) that is DOA. :(, As  watch lover, this is a HO-HUM watch. I got it for the chronograph and tritium lights. I was hoping for more. It feels cheap and cheesy. You need a magnifying glass to see the date.  I prefer mechanical, automatic watches but the really good ones are beyond my budget. I guess I'll keep the watch just so I can see the time at night and it's water proof., Just received this watch. Amazon Prime 2nd day delivery works!  This watch is awesome.  Very good value for the price.  Double it up with a matching women's version, Seiko SUT020 makes a perfect anniversary gift for couples.  I just did that for me and my wife as our 25th anniversary., A really good, affordable watch.  My husband really likes it., Classy!, This item arrived in a torn box/case and the bracelet part of the watch was broken. It is very cute but poor quality. I had to return it., It was delivered on time, thanks!! My boyfriend received it and said it was a badass watch! Just a little hard to read time, yes., excelente, excelente, ok, The price for this watch is amazing!  It is so worth it and more!  The face is a little larger then the watch I used to wear, but I really like it.  The silicone band is really comfortable and it moves with you and doesn't cut in.  The numbers are large and easy to read.  At this price, I will probably buy another one for myself, as well as a couple for gifts for friends!, I Love it; could not beat the price I paid for it..... Getting Compliments on the first day of wearing it. NICE!!!!, Made in china, This is a well made watch band.  Much better than the cheap one that came with the watch and started falling apart within a couple of months.  This one is well stitched and should last quite a while., 10 year battery!!!, Love this watch. Wear it all the time. Matter of fact I'm wearing it right now as I'm writing this review about it, EXCELENTE, It is an attractive watch. It's a bit too thick and a bit too heavy for me. The buttons are too hard to press. The biggest issue I have with the watch is that the white hands are hard to see against the white watch-face with a quick glance in less than perfect light. One last complaint is that the watch tick is loud enough to hear in a quiet room even when your wrist is a few feet away from your ear.  I really like the looks of the watch but due to the issues mentioned above, I will be sending it back., I have gotten so many complements on this watch. Everyone always asks, &#34;omg! Where did you get that?! Must have cost you a small fortune!&#34;<br /><br />Gorgeous watch through and through. Strongly recommend for all music lovers out there. It's a great buy!, This watch is great. Dial is of decent size, numbers easy to read. I have a few things that I find slightly annoying but not quite a deal breaker. First the indigo light button is a little off in that when you are in other operating modes such as the chrono and timer you can't operate it. Second if you are operating in seperate modes such as chrono and timer the watch will change back to the time mode leaving whatever mode you are in. I only mention this because quite often I'll do 30 second sprints followed by a lift and rather than having the watch stay in timer mode it switches back to the time mode. I know they are small things but I thought worth mentioning., This was a gift for my sister. Very simple and basic watch, but cool color., Was psyched that I was able to find this on amazon for an amazing price. Just bummed that the battery only lasted about a month after I received the watch. That's super unusual since all my other G-shock watches have lasted 4-6 years before needing battery replacement., Nice watch, well-established design.  Brand new, new packaging, but dead battery in less than two weeks.  Must have been on the shelf for a LONG time., great-looking watch! oversize dial is perfect!, OK, Very handsome watch, keeps perfect time and is easy to read.  My husband is very happy with his gift., Wear this every day and easy to read and comfortable., I bought this watch for my husband,  he was expecting a bigger Invicta watch. This watch is normal size but it's Ok for him. For me I like it and works fine., For the price you can't go wrong. It's comfortable and I don't have to worry about damaging it. A perfect work watch!, Excellent watch, The tic-tac sound could be less annoying... it is loud in my opinion. It is a cheap decent watch. I like the back-light function and it looks more resistant than I would expect for this price., One of the greatest purchases imaginable. It works like a dream, looks like a fantasy, and is even as heavy and thick as a $30 watch I have. Thing is a must-have as far as accessories go., Bought it for my Dad....Its been 2 years now and still looks new. Awesome Product!, This is a nice looking, well made watch that is quite accurate at keeping the time.  The only negative thing I can say about the product is that the band is just a bit too small for me.  I understand that at 6'6&#34; and 250lbs I'm larger than average so I can give them a pass on that one and I will just have to pick up a larger watch band.<br /><br />The watch runs off an internal battery and if it does last the 2.5 years they rate it at I will be very happy.  The controls are simple with a single dial used to adjust the time and day of the week / date portion of the watch.  Even without instructions it was easy to figure out how to set the watch with pulling it out slightly letting you change the day of the week and date and pulling it out fully let you adjust the time.<br /><br />The watch itself is a perfect size for my wrist and I like the white numbers on black background as it makes it easy to see the time quickly and easily.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice watch, if you're giving it as a gift to a taller / larger guy you might want to get a larger band to go with it.  Recommended.<br /><br />Sample provided for review., Very bright.  I especially like the NATO cloth/nylon band included as most rubber bands on watches like this are annoying and uncomfortable., I never take it off!, This watch, I bought for my 11yr old to go diving in the lake with, is HUGE! It's about to big for my husband, Can't say much about this watch that hasnt been said already. But overall the watch is great. Everything is what I expected (including battery life). Coming from a Pebble watch, I knew that it was going to be a challenge since i never thought about charging my watch normally, and at most would connect my watch 2 out of three days a week. I love the watch and although I'll miss the battery life, I really like the ability to interact directly with a lot of the features on my phone, easy tasker integration, and lots of watchfaces. I could have easily gone with the new pebble time, but wanted a change from pebble, and felt that the numerous screen tearing issues were just frustrating. I went through three regular pebble watches. Moving to this watch has been a breeze. Found a decent app that gave me good watchfaces, and now I've got a Pip Boy watchface. People have been saying to wait until the new version comes out, and if you can wait, then maybe you should to see how everything pans out. But if you're in the market for a new watch, definitely look into picking this watch up., The band is described as leather!! I don't think so.<br />The band has started to tear!!, an awesome watch when you don't want to take an expensive watch out.  I always get compliments on it., The watch came in as shown and of high quality will recommend to all Barcelona fans it is a collectors item, Fast delivery and best looking watch I ever seen, I think it just cheapens up the look of the AP., I bought this watch for my boyfriend for his birthday and we both love it! It's very stylish and I'd definitely buy this watch again! Very happy with it!, Lovely watch but NOT easy to read if you have any form of presbyopia.  Will be returning this..., Got this last Christmas (2014)  Less than year old and loses time.  I've replace the battery twice.  It gets stuck randomly for some unknown reason.  I can't trust it.  =(  Looks nice, just can't count on it.  Is this common with Invicta??, Very pleased with the watch and met my expectations upon delivery., The best gift by far, Very high quality., Very great build---obviously a quality strap that is certainly worth the money invested. If you've a Pebble Time, or similar watch profile, this will solve the annoyance from &#34;watch-turn&#34;--that annoying sensation of your watch falling onto the backside of your wrist. (Those of us with smaller wrists, this is the bane of our existence and likely why we don't wear watches.<br /><br />The band is exceptionally tough and dries very fast after being immersed. My only complaint isn't to do with the seller, or the product, but with the shipper. USPS is, by-and-large, the WORST shipper I have ever dealt with. To give you an idea, I ordered a 20-pound sewing serger, with Amazon gift wrapping, during the WEEK FOLLOWING when my band was due here, and the larger product arrived, to my house, before my band did. And when I called the Post Office? Hah--&#34;we'll conduct an investigation into it&#34;<br /><br />Only after that call were the week-old updates finally given any sort of refresh, and then, they indicated that this package sat in Brooklyn FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK. The seller paid for Priority Shipping and I'm almost certain it would have made it in the same time-frame had they chosen standard mail. The worst part about this? There is literally no recourse that can be taken to show USPS just how terrible they are, other than refusing to use their service. Any Amazon seller that reads this, make the switch to UPS---they actually give a crap whether your customer gets their stuff.<br /><br />All that being said, B and R Bands Customer service, when I called wondering where my band was was absolutely superb--they empathized with me and told me that the only reason they chose USPS (since they were well aware of their level of competency) was to provide the customer with a cheaper shipping option--I can't fault them for caring about my wallet. And the next band I need, I WILL be checking their inventory first, because you just don't get that kind of follow-up and follow through from anyone else.<br /><br />Keep on rocking, B and R Bands!, This is my third Citizens Eco-drive watch so it is clear I really like these watches.  As long as it gets sunlight, the eco-drive mechanism never needs any attention and keeps incredibly accurate time over very long (years) stretches of time.  I bought this particular watch because I wanted an attractive watch for dressier occasions.  The gold watch matched to a very nice looking expandable gold watch band fits the bill perfectly.  The watch face is champagne colored which I liked much more than the white faced eco-drive I also considered.  The watch is 36mm in diameter which is small by today's standards, but I like the smaller diameter.  I had my doubts about the expandable watch band, but once I got it properly fitted (two tries) I find it is very comfortable and looks terrific.  The watch is minimally water resistant - to sweat and light rain.  Overall this watch is exactly what I was looking for, and I can wholeheartedly recommend the Eco-drive mechanism., Beautiful watch, arrived quickly, but with a DEAD BATTERY., I absolutely love the watch didnt know the face was that big, Could be better, Really neat, Beautiful watch!  Much better than images, lustrous dial makes a nice contrast., I give you 3 start cause the watch come with a little stain., Beautiful!, I love it! I looked up the instructions online for how to use it because the instructions came in Japanese but once I got the hang of it I was great!, Fits the watch. Now it does not look like the straps were ever broken., Beautiful on wrist. Hands are hard to see. Really have to focus to tell the time until I can get use to it. Clasp is easy to manage., very good watch, would highly recommend to the &#34;survival&#34; type folks out there. this type of  &#34;ABC&#34; watch is perfect when a cell phone just wont cut it out in the woods. the tough solar is an added plus by not needing to replace the battery. the only disadvantage is the lug size if 14mm. i am using a strap by www.survivalstraps.com and i had to buy an adapter to make it fit right. other then that its a solid watch with awesome features., I received this watch today , it looks great , but it's really difficult to adjust the time .  I didn't find how to adjust it yet . Anyway , I will figure it out . Good watch. By the way , when I ordered this watch , it said that It companies with a gift . But when I opened it , there was nothing except the watch , a little bit disappointed ., This is a gorgeous watch that you really need to see in person. Yes it looks nice in pictures, but up close it is stunning. First, I love the elegant packaging- very sturdy, sharp, and presents the watch beautifully. The instructions are clear and it is simple to set, plus it comes with the full international warranty. It is a nice heavy weight, indicative of the quality of the piece. The clasp is solid. The gold overlay is pristine- it shines without looking flashy/gaudy. The watch face is clean, very easy to read, and looks classy. This watch can definitely be used every day, and would be just as appropriate to wear for a dressy occasion. I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and will look at purchasing other Alexander watches in the future without hesitation., I like it but it's always a minute late. the color hasn't change yet so I'm giving it 4 stars., I've never had a bad experience with a Timex product until I bought this watch a couple of months ago. That said, Timex is still my go to company for reliable watches, but this particular model is just consistently unreliable in my experience. The original watch I ordered worked as expected for a month, but one day entered a permanent unresponsive state where all I could do was view the time: No buttons responded whatsoever. I assumed that this was a rare defect and that having it sent to Timex under warranty would resolve the issue, but I was mistaken. Timex sent a replacement that began to malfunction even faster than the original (I started to notice the issue within 2 weeks, which only got worse). The light would sporadically go on and off by itself and would usually engage indiglo mode repeatedly as well. Because of this, it was beeping every few seconds whenever indiglo was turned on or off and I just had to go outside and throw it away before I lost my mind.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to go back to using my 6 year old Iron Man watch until I can find a newer model that won't suffer from these absurd issues., Received quickly.  Worked like a charm. Saved money not needing a jeweler. Couldn't be more pleased., Very pleased with the watch., pretty, My husband says it is just right!, Works as advertised., ok, Awesome watch and easy to configure, everything Excellent, When I opened the watch, it was not working. The battery was dead, I guess, Beautiful boyfriend watch! Exactly like the picture!, Keeps perfect time and looks nice! No fuss, no muss., The watch arrived with a dead battery., Large heavy watch!, Love the watch. It is a lot thinner than my old Forester wave ceptor. I love the fact that I don't have to worry about having accurate time or needing to replace batteries. My only complaint is that the bands on the newer watches wear out before the watch and cannot be replaced, making a perfectly good watch worthless., Indiglo is why it's only 3 stars. If they could make this with a longer lasting glowing material for the hands and numbers etc. than it would be a 5 Star for sure for me.<br />A sharp face to look at and fetching to the passerby however the band was a bit smaller on me than I'd like. I did switch the band out with a cloth style band from bertucci and it looks and feels great., Watch face is great; leather band tearing already after wearing 3 days\n",
